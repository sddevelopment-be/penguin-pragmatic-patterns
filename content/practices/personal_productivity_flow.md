In recent years, microsoft has pivotted towards providing office-as-a-service applications.
Most if these can be easily incorporated into your personal workflow. Having everything online makes it easier to be
productive, without losing your mobility.

## Problem Statement

You find it difficult to remember what you want to achieve, and are distrought by the amount of tasks you have yet to finish.

## Intent

* Find peace of mind by offloading your ideas and tasks to an external system.
* Habitually use your tracking system to stay on top of your tasks, and ideas.
* Experiment and find a knowledge/task storage system that fits your lifestyle.

## Contextual forces

{{<whatis text=`
These describe factors at play that influence the outcome of the practice. They are not necessarily good or bad, but they are important to be
aware of. Some contextual forces are enablers, giving the practice a higher chance of being useful. Others are deterrents, making the practice less useful
in your given context.` >}}

* People are often distracted by their own thoughts.
* Having mental "open loops"[^0] is tiring, and stressful.
* It is difficult to keep up the habbot of organizing your ideas.
* Most productivity applications and techniques force you into a particular set of tools.

### Enablers

* You are able to write relatively quickly.
* You are able to think critically of the ideas you have.
* You can plan your time expendature in advance, and are discipined enough to stick to it (mostly).
* You have a device that you bring with you to most places, or have a toolset that you can access from anywhere.

### Deterrents

* You have little control over how you spend your time.
* Even though you plan events, they usually fall through.
* You have a particularly difficult time picking up new habbits.
* You tend to change your system too often, not allowing yourself to get used to it.
* You are not able to note down your thoughts quickly (slow writing speed, analysis-paralasis).
* You generally spend more time refining your methods, or toolset, rather than focussing on the things you want to do.

## Solution

Use a personalized productivity flow, using whatever tool (or combination of tools) you feel comfortable with.
Make sure your chosen toolset is readily available, and trustworthy. 
For some, this will be a pen-and-paper system. Others prefer to leverage their digital prowess and lifestyle to have
their productivity tool available to them constantly[^1]. 

Whichever tools you choose, make sure you:

* Have a specific location to dump out your thoughts
* Regularly review your brain dump tool and curate it. Some of your ideas will be crappy. Get rid of them.
* You should **trust** your tools. Peace of mind only happens when you are convinced your ideas and to-dos are stored reliably.
* Categorize and Prioritize your thoughts **after** you have collected them
  * The Eisenhower Matrix (described below) is an excellent technique to do this
  * differentiate between "things to remember" and "things that require action"
  * assign "due dates" if able

### Mind like water

One of the most popular personal productivity methods is called the _"Getting things done"_ method[^2].
The core ideas of the GTD approach is to have:

* A place to note down ideas or tasks that pop into your head
* A way to organize these by priority or type of work to do
* A calendar to plan time-allocations in

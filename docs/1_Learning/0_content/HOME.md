# Why learn about learning?

## Meta-Learning

Meta learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as "the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in
control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized". Maudsley sets the conceptual basis of his
theory as synthesized under headings of assumptions, structures, change process, and facilitation. Five principles were enunciated to
facilitate meta learning. Learners must:

- have a theory,however primitive
- work in a safe supportive social and physical environment
- discover their rules and assumptions
- reconnect with reality-information from the environment
- reorganize themselves by changing their rules/assumptions.

# Knowledge representation

The image above is an ideation map, showing us how a person gathers information. You will see how our "knowledge aggregator" interacts with
a few relevant _"systems"_. From this simplified visualization, we see that how one perceives information is dependent of oneself, and the context
one lives in.

When you talk to people, you rely on a shared understanding of the language and terminology you use. The words you use will vary depending on
whom you are speaking to, what you are discussing, and even how you are feeling at that particular time. Even more interestingly,
how we talk about things tends to influence how we think about them. This means that if you spend most of your time complaining about something,
you will perceive it as being more of a pain than it actually was before you started communicating negatively about it.

A [pattern language](/X_Appendix/Glossary/HOME?id=pattern-language) is **a formal way to represent wisdom that improves ones ability to operate in a
certain field of expertise**. The knowledge represented in a pattern language is usually stripped down to its bare essentials, in hopes of making it easier to apply them in a
variety of situations.

Much like a dictionary, each entry (_"Pattern"_) in these knowledge bases is indexed with a `name` and contains information
on `what challenge it addresses` as well as a `description of the context in which it works well`.

Sharing knowledge with other practitioners in a formalized manner is an activity that is generally used in a variety of fields. Chess
players share certain board positions and [common tactics](https://chesstempo.com/tactical-motifs) by manner of "motifs"[^1] . In popular
internet culture, we see the same as plenty communication happens using memes and tropes[^2] . Recent marketing campaigns, and
elections in various countries have seen an uptick in using funny pictures and videos on the web to influence peoples decision-making.

We want to share information about both things you can do, and about ideas and models that can change the way you perceive a situation. To achieve
this, the patterns in this knowledge base are split up into: `Concepts` and `Practices`. To keep the content in this work consistent, the patterns
follow a similar structure. As we now know, **context matters**. This is why each pattern is prefaced with a short description of when it can be
useful to consider using it.

Some patterns will contain references to other resources. They can also contain supporting examples, testimonials, tutorials, etc.
These examples can be included inside the pattern description, but they might as well exist as a separate resource in a different section of
this publication.

# Why learn about learning?

## Meta-Learning

Meta learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as "the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in
control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized". Maudsley sets the conceptual basis of his
theory as synthesized under headings of assumptions, structures, change process, and facilitation. Five principles were enunciated to
facilitate meta learning. Learners must:

- have a theory,however primitive
- work in a safe supportive social and physical environment
- discover their rules and assumptions
- reconnect with reality-information from the environment
- reorganize themselves by changing their rules/assumptions.

# Knowledge representation

The image above is an ideation map, showing us how a person gathers information. You will see how our "knowledge aggregator" interacts with
a few relevant _"systems"_. From this simplified visualization, we see that how one perceives information is dependent of oneself, and the context
one lives in.

When you talk to people, you rely on a shared understanding of the language and terminology you use. The words you use will vary depending on
whom you are speaking to, what you are discussing, and even how you are feeling at that particular time. Even more interestingly,
how we talk about things tends to influence how we think about them. This means that if you spend most of your time complaining about something,
you will perceive it as being more of a pain than it actually was before you started communicating negatively about it.

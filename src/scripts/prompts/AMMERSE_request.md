Please proofread this pattern on ``. The pattern consists of a problem statement, intent, contextual forces (drivers), and a solution.
The pattern is written in a conversational tone, and uses British English spelling.
The format of the pattern is HuGo-enhanced markdown. Assume all footnotes are correctly linked, and all referenced images are present.

Tell me what the core message of the pattern is, who its intended audience is, when the pattern works well, and when it does not.

Tell me what the impact of using this technique is, for each of the AMMERSE values. For this AMMERSE evaluation, I want to 
evaluate the impact of applying the pattern in an existing context and whether it would cause an increase, or decrease in the
contextual support of the AMMERSE value.
Use a scale from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a significant decrease, 0 indicates no impact, and 1 indicating a significant increase in
support for the value. Example values are -0.3, 0.8, 0, etc. Succinctly explain the reasoning behind the value you assign to each AMMERSE value.
Be critical of the potential negative impacts of applying a value, and take the feedback loops between the different AMMERSE values into account for
the most prominently impacted values. Be sure to outline any potential drawbacks of the techniques evaluated, regardless of whether mitigation strategies exist.
For each of the AMMERSE values:

First, focus only on the positive aspects of the technique, and provide a score.
Then, focus only on the negative aspects of the technique, and provide a score.
Next, combine both evaluations using simple summation.

List the considerations to be made when applying this technique.
Specifically, focus on the potential accidental and undesirable effects of using it.
I am interested in evaluating how the environment changes when using the technique, not specifically on the technique itself or any artifacts it
produces.

Provide me with potential mitigation strategies for the considerations you listed.

Note that I want a critical evaluation of the technique, and how it would impact day-to-day operations in a professional environment. I am
particularly concerned about the potential downsides of implementing a technique like this, and would like to be aware of the trade-offs I am
making. Therefore, it is paramount to evaluate the effect of the technique itself on the AMMERSE values that are present in the context.

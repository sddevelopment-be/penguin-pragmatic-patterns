## Organize your workflow

### Context

### Drivers

* You want to finalize your tasks and "get things done"
* People are often distracted by their own thoughts
* Multitasking is hard. Our brains work better if we can compartmentalize between different modes of thinking
* Our memories are very lossy. We tend to forget about things all the time
* Standard To-Do lists have no readily available means of prioritizing items
* Having too many things on our mind stresses us out

### Solution

Use a personalozed productivity flow, using whatever tool you feel comfortable in. 
For some, this will be a pen-and-paper system. Others prefer to leverage their digital prowess and lifestyle to have theis productivity 
tool available all the time[^1]. One of the most popular personal productivity methods is called the _"Getting things done"_ method[^2].

**Whatever method you choose, make sure to:**

* Have a specific location to dump out your thoughts
* You should **trust** your tools. Peace of mind only happens when you are convinced your ideas and todos are stored reliably
* Regularly review your braindump tool and curate it. Some of your ideas will be crappy. Get rid of them.
* Categorize and Prioritize your thoughts **after** you have collected them
  * The Eisenhouwer Matrix is an excellent technique to do this
  * differentiate between "things to remember" and "things that require action"
  * assign "due dates" if able

#### Eisenhouwer priority Matrix

Organize your action items according to:
* their **importance**: actions can be either `important` or `unimportant`
* their **urgency**: these are either `urgent` or `not urgent`

This leaves you with a nice 2-by-2 grid in which to place your actionable items[^3].


### Examples

#### Personal productivity flow using MS online tooling

In recent years, microsoft has pivotted towards providing office-as-a-service applications.
Most if these can be easily incorporated into your personal workflow. Having everything online makes it easier to be productive,
without losing your mobility.

This section includes a variety of programming patterns that have been collected, and put to use
in both personal and professional projects. In order to make learning them a bit easier, we have included
code samples to these patterns. They can help you understand the approaches described in the patterns and offer
a great way of getting some practical experience with them. The code included in the patterns can be written in a variety of languages, but the default language is Oracle Java. 

The table with resources below can assist you in downloading the development environments you need to work with the included code samples.

# 4_Software_development

There a a few reasons why we think writing computer programs is cool.
First of all, the general idea of “making a machine do work for you so you don’t have to do it” is appealing to us.
Throughout history, humans have always looked for ways to make their lives easier. Around the 18th century us humans figured out we can get more work done if we delegate the tricky bits to machines.
These machines will perform routine tasks without getting tired, or bored. By making our mechanical marvels do our busy work, we were able to spend more time on dealing with the creative side of things.
This left us with ample time to focus on learning new and beter ways of working.

To me, this is one of the primary reasons why I love being a developer so much.
Being skilled in the craft of automation makes life a lot easier.
Apart from that, I really love solving puzzles .

If you like a challenge, solving problems, and learning new skills, software development might just be your cup of tea.

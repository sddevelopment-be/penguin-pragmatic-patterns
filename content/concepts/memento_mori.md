## Definition

Memento Mori is a Latin phrase meaning _"Remember you will die"_. It serves as a reminder of our mortality and encourages us to live life fully,
appreciating each moment while being mindful of the legacy we leave behind.

## Key Components

* **Awareness of Mortality:** Recognizing that life is finite and that death is an inevitable part of existence[^1].
* **Living Fully:** Using the awareness of mortality as motivation to live a meaningful and fulfilling life.
* **Legacy and Impact:** Reflecting on how one's actions and choices will be remembered and what impact they will have on others.

## Background

### Origin

The concept of Memento Mori dates back to ancient Rome, where it was used to remind individuals, particularly those in power, of their mortality.
This reminder was intended to keep them humble and focused on living virtuously.

The ancient Romans believed that being aware of our mortality, enabled us to experience life more fully and virtuously.
They advise us to understand our core values and live by them. Do not wait until tomorrow to do that which can be done today.  
If you die tomorrow, did you leave things in a good state for those that stay around?  
Did you live how you wanted to live? What will people say about who you were as a person?

While the knowledge of our own mortality can drive us to be the best version of ourselves, it can also help to not consider ourselves
indispensable. While being productive is important, we should not forget to spend time with our loved ones, or take a few moments to relax and
enjoy ourselves[^2]. After all, the graveyards are filled with indispensable people.

### Application

Memento Mori can be applied in daily life as a tool for mindfulness and reflection. It encourages individuals to prioritize what truly matters, make
the most of their time, and ensure their actions align with their values.

### Comparisons

Memento Mori is similar to other philosophical and religious practices that emphasize the transient nature of life, such as the Buddhist concept of
impermanence and the Stoic practice of negative visualization. Other religious traditions, such as Christianity, also incorporate the passing of
time and the inevitability of death into their teachings to encourage virtuous living.

In contrast, the hedonistic philosophy of Epicureanism focuses on seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, while Memento Mori encourages individuals to
consider the long-term impact of their actions. Nihilism, which also emphasizes our eventual demise, rejects the idea of inherent meaning or purpose
in life, leading to a highly different set of conclusions.


### Examples

* **Personal Reflection:** Taking time each day to reflect on one's mortality and considering whether current actions and decisions align with
  long-term values and goals.
* **Productivity:** Using the awareness of limited time to prioritize important tasks and avoid procrastination.
* **Relationships:** Valuing and nurturing relationships, understanding that time with loved ones is finite.

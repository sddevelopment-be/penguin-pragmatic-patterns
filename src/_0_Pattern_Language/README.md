Exchanging knowledge is a challenging activity. The aim is to communicate thoughts and ideas in a way that makes them resonate with the
receiving party. To communicate effectively, groups of people tend to resort to using jargon. The term `jargon` means _"The
specialized language of a trade, profession, or similar group, especially when viewed as difficult to understand by outsiders."_. Its goal
is to make the exchange of information more efficient by giving specific names to things that are highly relevant to the in-group. It is
said that the Inuit have over thirty words to differentiate between different types of snow. Other professions, such as software developers,
make heavy use of metaphors to refer to technical concepts.

## Structuring what we know

When looking for a structured way to represent ideas, experiences, or cookbooks (i.e. knowledge), it helps to first take a look at what we
know of _"knowledge"_ itself. Us software developers tend to resort to modeling things when we want to understand them a bit better. Drawing
out our ideas, and how they relate to each other helps us create a "map" of reality.

### Noise or signal?

> Human beings have the unique ability to name things that do not exist, and reason about them.

When you talk to people, you rely on a shared understanding of the language and terminology you use.

## So, what is a Pattern Language?

A pattern language is **a formal way to represent wisdom that improves ones ability to operate in a certain field of expertise**. The
knowledge represented in a pattern language is usually stripped down to its bare essentials, in hopes of making it easier to apply them in a
variety of situations.

Much like a dictionary, each entry (_"Pattern"_) in these knowledge bases is indexed with a `name` and contains information
on `what challenge it addresses` as well as a `description of the context in which it works well`.

Sharing knowledge with other practitioners in a formalized manner is an activity that is generally used in a variety of fields. Chess
players share certain board positions and [common tactics](https://chesstempo.com/tactical-motifs) by manner of "motifs"[^1] . In popular
internet and online messaging culture, we see the same with the abundant use of memes and tropes[^2] . Recent marketing campaigns, and
elections in various countries have seen an uptick in the use of funny pictures and videos on the web in order to influence peoples decision
making.

> [!NOTE]
> [from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language): A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of patterns, each of
> which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise.

## The pattern structure used in this knowledge base

### Patterns

For consistency, the patterns follow a similar structure.
As we all know, **context matters**. This is why each pattern is prefaced with a short description of
when it can be useful to consider using it.

We want to share information about both things you can do, and about ideas and models that can change the way you perceive a
situation. In order to achieve this, the patterns in this knowledge base are divided into: `Concepts` and `Practices`.

#### Concepts

#### Practices

Practices are a set of actionable recipes, that can help you achieve certain goals.
As with all advice, these are not guaranteed to give results. There is no such thing as a
sure-fire approach that works in any situation. To make these patterns as helpful as possible, they include a short description of the
circumstances in which they usually work well.

> [!WARNING] **This is not a bingo chart.**  
> Unlike Pokemon, you will not get a special prize for implementing all of them in your life.
> You are encouraged to be eclectic, and only use the practices that resonate with you.

## About this publication

This work is a learning and development knowledge base, aimed to share knowledge with other technical professionals.
The docs section of this repository acts as somewhat of a “personal wiki”. It contains knowledge and information that
has been collected from various sources, and is extended with some personal interpretations and
experiences of the author.

> [!NOTE]
> As this knowledge base will likely remain a work in progress for some while,
> not all content will be refined. It is advisable to check out the [Changelog](/X_Appendix/HOME?id=changelog) in order
> to see what has changed recently.

### Purpose

As we live our lives, we tend to learn a great deal about a wide variety of topics.
From time to time we are stumped by how elegant, or easy, someone solves a certain problem. You are left wondering
why you have not been tackling similar problems in the same way. It could have saved you vast amounts of frustration, if
only you had known earlier.

This catalog aims to bundle little nuggets of enlightenment these aha-moments tend to deliver.
We hope that someone, somewhere learns something that makes their lives a bit more enjoyable.

### Intended Audience

This knowledge base is intended for people that are interested in improving theis current way of working (or living)
by learning about alternative approaches.
You will likely already be familiar with some ideas in this knowledge base, in which case: feel free to
move on. If you think we are blabbering and giving bad advice, feel free to leave a comment or suggestion
on the [github page](https://github.com/sddevelopment-be/penguin-pragmatic-patterns).

### Structure

This open knowledge collection is ordered by categories. Each category contains some of the following
resources:

- **A collection of Patterns:** Little snippets of information to inspire you. These can be used as general pieces of
  advice that may or may not be applicable to your current situation. To maximize their usefulness, these patterns (or
  motifs) follow a similar structure.
- **Articles and short-form information:** These sections contain a list of articles that were written by either myself
  or others and added with their permission. These articles can be opinionated pieces, additional context, or specific
  case-studies.
- **Resources and Reviews :** Additional information related to a topic, that do not easily fit the other sections.
  These might include book recommendations, tutorials, tool recommendations, etc.

A set of concepts and common abbreviations can be found in the [glossary](/X_Appendix/Glossary/HOME).

If you are interested in diving deeper into some subjects mentioned in this work, be sure to take a look at
the [Reading list](/X_Appendix/Learning_Materials/HOME) section included in the appendices. There, you will find an
overview of great books, articles, and audiovisual recourses that are worth checking out.

## A pattern-based approach

Exchanging knowledge is a challenging activity. The aim is to communicate thoughts and ideas in a way that makes them
resonate with the receiving party. To communicate effectively, groups of people tend to resort to using jargon.
The term `jargon` means: _"The specialized language of a trade, profession, or similar group,
especially when viewed as difficult to understand by outsiders."_.
Its goal is to make the exchange of information more efficient by giving specific names to things that are relevant to
the in-group. It is said that the Inuit have over thirty words to differentiate between different types of snow.
Other professions, such as software developers, strongly rely on metaphors to refer to technical concepts.

When looking for a structured way to represent ideas, experiences, or cookbooks (i.e. knowledge), it helps to first take
a look at how we see _"knowledge"_ itself. Us software developers tend to resort to modeling things when we want to
understand them a bit better. By visualizing our ideas, and how they relate to each other, we create a "map" of how we
perceive a certain set of concepts.

### Knowledge representation

![A simplified model of the things we know ><](./knowledge_gathering.png ':size=680')

The image above is an ideation map, showing us how a person gathers information. You will see how our "knowledge aggregator" interacts with
a few relevant _"systems"_. From this simplified visualization, we see that how one perceives information is dependent of oneself, and the context
one lives in.

![Visual representation of how thoughts and ideas form >](structurizr-BeliefDomain.png ':size=360')

When you talk to people, you rely on a shared understanding of the language and terminology you use. The words you use will vary depending on
whom you are speaking to, what you are discussing, and even how you are feeling at that particular time. Even more interestingly,
how we talk about things tends to influence how we think about them. This means that if you spend most of your time complaining about something,
you will perceive it as being more of a pain than it actually was before you started communicating negatively about it.

A [pattern language](/X_Appendix/Glossary/HOME?id=pattern-language) is **a formal way to represent wisdom that improves ones ability to operate in a
certain field of expertise**. The
knowledge represented in a pattern language is usually stripped down to its bare essentials, in hopes of making it easier to apply them in a
variety of situations.

Much like a dictionary, each entry (_"Pattern"_) in these knowledge bases is indexed with a `name` and contains information
on `what challenge it addresses` as well as a `description of the context in which it works well`.

Sharing knowledge with other practitioners in a formalized manner is an activity that is generally used in a variety of fields. Chess
players share certain board positions and [common tactics](https://chesstempo.com/tactical-motifs) by manner of "motifs"[^1] . In popular
internet culture, we see the same as plenty communication happens using memes and tropes[^2] . Recent marketing campaigns, and
elections in various countries have seen an uptick in using funny pictures and videos on the web to influence peoples decision-making.

![Representation of learning by experimenting ><](./experimental-entities-Component.png ':size=520')

We want to share information about both things you can do, and about ideas and models that can change the way you perceive a situation. To achieve
this, the patterns in this knowledge base are split up into: `Concepts` and `Practices`. To keep the content in this work consistent, the patterns
follow a similar structure. As we now know, **context matters**. This is why each pattern is prefaced with a short description of when it can be
useful to consider using it.


Enjoy reading and learning!

[^1] Unfortunately knowing this does not instantly make you a great chess player, as my elo on online platforms so adequately reminds me.

[^2] So wide-spread even, that academics have [started investigating](https://www.michelecoscia.com/?page_id=2070) what makes some memes
successful while others are doomed to be left in the ditches of the web.

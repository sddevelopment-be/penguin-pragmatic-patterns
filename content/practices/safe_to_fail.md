## Problem Statement

* When learning new skills, a large part of the process does not yield immediate or desirable results.
* We are hard-wired to avoid failure. 
  * This is a good thing, as it helps us survive. 
  * It also makes us avoid trying new things, as we are afraid of failing.

## Intent

Create an environment where trying out new ideas, or practicing new skills becomes less scary. This should allow you to learn new things faster, 
and with less stress. You might even have some fun while doing it.

## Contextual forces

{{<whatis text=`
These describe factors at play that influence the outcome of the practice. They are not necessarily good or bad, but they are important to be 
aware of. Some contextual forces are enablers, giving the practice a higher chance of being useful. Others are deterrents, making the practice less useful 
in your given context.` >}}

### Enablers

* Your environment values gaining and sharing knowledge.
* You are in a safe environment, where failure is not punished.
* Your learning goals are clear to you, and you are motivated to achieve them.
* You are able to break down your learning goals into small, achievable, verifiable steps.
* You are able to take the results from your learning experiments, and apply it to your work.

### Deterrents

* You do not particularly care about learning new things.
* Your environment does not value learning, or is unwilling to invest in it.
* There is an expert present, who already knows how to do the thing you are trying to learn.[^1]
* You are in an environment where optics are more important than results, and failure is punished.

[^1]: This one is somewhat counter-intuitive, but it is a real thing. If you are trying to learn something, and there is an expert present, you 
(or your organization) will be tempted to ask them to pick up the work. Reliance on skilled individuals can be detrimental to your growth, 
as it results in you learning how to ask the expert for help, rather than refine your own skills. This is not a bad thing, but it is not what you set out to do.

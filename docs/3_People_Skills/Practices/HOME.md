## Walking the talk


### Context

Quick! Think of that one person who said something, and then showed they did not mean it by how they were behaving.  
Did you think of someone? Maybe it was hard to choose only one person, as people tend to do this often.

How did you feel about that person afterwards? Do you trust them?
Do you feel they were being honest?   
Or perhaps you think they acted in the most hypocritical way imaginable [^0].

### Drivers

* People tend to remember past interactions and assume future interactions will be similar
* Non-verbal communication, such as body language and actions, tell us more than words ever could
* You come over as trustworthy if you have a history of acting in an honest, and professional manner. Conversely, you
  will be perceived as unreliable if you fail to do so.
* _“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit.”_ ~ Will Durant[^1].
  Neuroscience has proven that our brains _'rewire'_ themselves by repeating actions over and over.
  This is what makes habits, trauma, and false beliefs so hard to break.
* We live and operate in a collaborative society. It is in our own best interest if others are willing to help us out,
  and trust us.
* Forcing yourself to act against your beliefs is one of the known causes of occupational burnout. Research refers to this as _"
  conflicting values"_ or _"loss of agency and control"_ [^2].

#### Enablers

* You have the means to keep track of time, and to take note of the promises you make.
* Your environment is comfortable holding people (including yourself) accountable for their promises, and preferably does so in a non-aggressive way
* You value honesty and reliability in others, and know the frustration of counting on someone who does not pull through
* You have access to low latency communication devices.

#### Deterrents

* Taking any form of responsibility is discouraged by your environment for whatever reason.
* You are expected to say "yes" to everything, regardless of whether you mean it or not.
* You do not care about being perceived as reliable

### Solution

Achieving this is actually quite simple. Simple, but not easy.
The core behaviours to be congruent in words and actions are:  
* "Say what you mean, and mean what you say"
* Respond in a clear way, and follow through. Do not make promises you can not keep, or do not intend to keep.
  * Say "yes" when you mean "yes"
  * Say "no" when you mean "no"
  * Be forthcoming when you do not possess the information or agency required to give any of these answers, and refer to someone who does. Alternatively, you can tell the person making a request of you to check in a later time and make sure you have the required information by then.
* Do not back out of difficult interactions
* Admit when you made a mistake or break a promise, even when in public

As I said, the idea is very simple. But it can be very challenging to apply.
It usually goes wrong when the other party does not accept your answer. Be very careful of placating or "weaseling out" of giving a definitive and clear answer.
Weasel words include:
- "Maybe"
- "I will try"
- "If I find the time"
- "We'll see" followed by a vague promise to revisit the topic at an undefined point in time or in some alternate universe
- "I was late, because of XXXXX"
  

It is very easy to weasel out of making a commitment, as it takes courage to take accountability for the possibility of failure.
And there will be ample times where you make a commitment and break your promise. This can happen for whatever reason, and some of those reasons might even be valid.
Though here is the kicker: **your reasons for not pulling through are irrelevant to the people counting on you**.

To ameliorate the frustration people feel when you can not live up to your promises, **give them advance warning of your inability to follow through**.
This is not a silver bullet "fix all issues" approach, as you still wrote a check they can not cash. But at the very least, you give others the opportunity to change their plans if needed.
Do this too often, and your reputation will suffer. Do not do this often enough, and you will be perceived as a liar.


### Examples

#### The cake is a lie

![a conversation between Alex and his mom, filled to the brim with half-promisses and unclear communication <](./dialogue_broken_promises.png ':size=680')

This fictional dialogue between Alex and his mom illustrate a complete breakdown in communication. What went wrong here?
Who is to blame? The answer is somewhat convoluted, as all parties involved were not being clear. Alex made an initial commitment to his colleagues that he would provide homemade cake.
When making this promise, he knew he would have to ask someone for help, as he can not bake a cake to save his life. He assumed he could persuade his mother to bake the cake for him, as she used to do when he was a child.
At this point, Alex is acting in bad faith. He should have checked Brunhilda's availability and willingness to help him out before making a promise to his co-workers.  

During the phone call, Alex tried to manipulate his mother into making the cake even though Brunhilda clearly told him that she does not have the time to do so. 
Because her son was using his "nagging child" routine, and she wanted to get out of the conversation without any conflict, Brunhilda gave a non-committal response.
In doing so, Brunhilda acted against her own values of never making promises you can not keep. In her mind, she never made an explicit promise to help.
But that is not what Alex wanted to hear, so he decided to interpret it as an agreement to make the cake.  

Neither party decided to follow-up on the conversation. Brunhilda could have let Alex know that she would not be able to make the cake, as she unexpectedly had do deal with a problem at work.
Alex could have called his mother a few days before the party to check if she would be able to bake the cake. Alex could have also told his colleagues that they would likely have to make due with store-bought cake, and buy one as a fall-back plan.
From Alex' point of view, his mom was unreliable. From Alex' colleagues point of view, he failed to deliver on his promise, and they were forced to spend the evening cake-less.

## Problem

## Intent

## Contextual forces

### Enablers

* Being okay with non-complete respresentations.
* Modern technology makes it easy to create mindmaps.
* Visualizations are a tremendous helps in remembering facts. Popular culture is filled with the idea of "mind palaces", which is a technique used by people who display extraorinary capabilities or short-term memory storage.

### Deterrents

* Mindmaps are relatively high effort
* The resulting visual artefact of a mindmapping exercise becomes stale quickly
* Not knowing what concept to attach something to can lead to frustration or abandoning of the mindmap.

## Solution

Create a _mindmap_ that structure the core ideas of a certain domain or piece of work.
As a spiders web, the mindmap starts by putting a central concept or question at the center of the page.
You then attach words to this central theme, as they appear in your head.

Make sure not to put too much effort into your mindmap, the act of mapping is where the value lies.
You will soon realize that as your understanding grows, your map will no longer be accurate.
At this point, just create a new one. If you want to solidify your newfound knowledge, repeat this process until you are satisfied. 

If you work digitally, you can keep your mindmaps up to date a bit more easily as you will not run into spacing issues as fast. Though, if your sketch is not updated for a long time, consider ditching or revisting it, as it likely lost most of its value.

## Rationale

* We are good at thinking creatively, but our recollection is often times flawed. This leads us to forget about certain aspects
* Not knowing what something relates to makes it harder to remember facts.
* Humans prefer to think in structures, it has been shown that structuring a text or idea helps you refine the knowledge.

## Examples

### Mindmapping the concepts and intent of this publication

While preparing to write this publication, I considered what knowledge a software developer should have in order to be capable of handling most 
challenges. With "handling most challenges", I do not mean the developer will be able to draw upon existing solutions, but rather that they are able to combine this information in order to creativly think of a way to resolve the issue at hand.

This is what I came up with as a general structure, which you can see reflected in how this work has been structured.

This map was made digitally by using [PlantUml](https://plantuml.com/mindmap-diagram). This is a text-based graphing language, that you can play with on their online editor.
The main advantage here is that you can move quickly (provided your typing speed is up to par). As the syntax is very simple, the brain-to-screen barrier is quite low. Having a digital copy of your mindmap around can come in handy if you want to update it later on.

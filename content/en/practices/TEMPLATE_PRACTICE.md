## Problem statement

> [!STUB]
> Describe the problem that this pattern aims to solve

## Intent
> [!STUB]
> Describe the desired outcome

## Solution

> [!STUB]
> Describe the core idea of the pattern and how to apply it.
> Add subsections as you see fit in order to clearly communicate the idea

## Contextual forces

> [!STUB]
> A bullet list explaining why this pattern makes sense, try and be as objective as possible here
> The sections "Enablers" and "Deterents" can be used to divide the forces in a more structured way.

### Enablers
The following factors support effective application of the practice:

> [!STUB]
> Contextual factors that increase the viability of implementing the pattern

### Deterrents
The following factors prevent effective application of the practice:

> [!STUB]
> Contextual factors that decrease the viability of implementing the pattern

## Rationale

> [!STUB]
> Describe the reasoning behind the pattern, or go into more detail on why it works.

## Application

### Consequences
While the approach brings numerous benefits, it can also lead to several unexpected or undesired outcomes:

> [!STUB]
> Describe how the situation changes after applying the pattern
> Try and focus on elements that are not immediatly apperent from the "intent" section.
> Be sure to highlight potential unintended effects.

### Mitigation strategies
To mitigate the potential negative consequences of the approach:

> [!STUB]
> How to deal with, or prevent, potential negative consequences of applying the pattern

## Examples

> Case-studies, testimonials, or other examples that illustrate the pattern in action.

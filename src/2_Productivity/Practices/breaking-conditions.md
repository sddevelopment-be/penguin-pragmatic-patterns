### Context

### Drivers

It is hard to uphold commitments, it is equally hard to know when not to

#### Enablers

* We (generally) want to do what is good for ourselves, those close to us, and the people we care about
* The cost of choice while working with limited resources: choosing to invest your resources (time, energy, money, health) into an
  endeavour automatically makes it unavailable for investment elsewhere.
* We can [condition ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) by stating declarations of intent in _"When X happens, then I will Y"_. This [priming](https://en.
  wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_priming) making it easier to act in the way we want to. 


#### Deterrents

* People can pressure us into doing things against our will
* Sometimes we take the path of least resistance, even if it leads to a bad situation
* We are not purely rational beings: The feelings of _"loss"_ and _"failure"_ are not pleasant ones, as humans are hardwired to struggle
  for survival. We are also creatures of habit, favoring known situations over unknown ones.
* Goals are extremely motivating, but can push us well beyond our limits.
    * This is illustrated by marathon runners getting severally unwell
      and [still continuing the race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_marathon_fatalities), people dying while [climbing
      mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_died_climbing_Mount_Everest).

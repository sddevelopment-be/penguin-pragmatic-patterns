## Problem Statement

## Intent

We wish to maintain a higher level of code discipline, increasing the reliability of the code.

## Contextual forces

### Enablers

* Your language of choice has a recommended style guide
* Automated code analysis/linting is in place, or available
* Your team is coherent, and able to align on a preferred style
* Your development environment offers a way to share/import code styles

### Deterrents

* We have a need for expressing our individuality.
* You work with many distinct codebases or programming languages.
* Manually reviewing code for consistency is a tedious task, that most prefer to avoid.
* Normalization of deviance: if most of your operating process is "exceptional", the "exception" becomes the norm.

## Solution

## Reasoning

* Code is write-once, read-often.
* Working with consistent representations lowers mental load.
* Humans are excellent at recognizing deviations from the norm.

## Examples

### Nuke 'em, duke!

A great example of this is the use of brackets to identify code blocks in Java. While not strictly necessary to make your code compile or work, 
many teams explicitly ask their developers to include brackets, even on conditionals that could be written as one-liners. This particular 
convention tends to irk newer developers who like their code to be as concise as possible. 
While brevity is a usually a good thing, at other times it can be confusing. 

Let≈õ take a quick look at the code below, which checks whether we are under attack, and whether to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike.

```java
public void failSafe(boolean thePresidentIsDead){
    if(thePresidentIsDead)
        launchNukes();

    businessAsUsual();
}
```
   
Now imagine someone in the team is tasked to add logging statements to the entire codebase. 
They do as they are told, resulting in the code below.
At first glance, everything looks fine. Can you spot the cataclysmic mistake?

```java
public void failSafe(boolean thePresidentIsDead){
    LOG.info("Checking to see if everything is still okay...");

    if(thePresidentIsDead)
        LOG.warn("OMG! You killed him. You bastards!");
        launchNukes();

    LOG.info("Carry on, carrying on");
    businessAsUsual();
}
```

The nukes will be launched, regardless of the president being alive or not.
A simple log statement, combined with misleading indentation has set forth a thermonuclear apocalypse.

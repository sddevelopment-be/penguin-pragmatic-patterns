## Problem Statement

You find it difficult to decide what to do next, as you are unsure what would be the most beneficial choice for you.

## Intent

Use a mental framework to evaluate the possible options, and assist in making an informed decision that suits your needs.

## Contextual forces

{{<whatis text=`
These describe factors at play that influence the outcome of the practice. They are not necessarily good or bad, but they are important to be
aware of. Some contextual forces are enablers, giving the practice a higher chance of being useful. Others are deterrents, making the practice less useful
in your given context.` >}}

### Enablers

* You are aware of your personal goals and ambitions.
* You are in tune with your own needs, and can face them.
* You can allocate some time each day to invest in reflection.

### Deterrents

* You do not know what your goals and ambitions are.
* You are not in tune with your own needs, and are unable to face them.
* You are unable to manage yourself, and lack the discipline to tackle challenges.

## Solution

When considering what to do next, use the STEAM framework to evaluate the possible options. 
The model applies an economical perspective to the resources you have available, and how you can use them to your advantage.
While this way of evaluating trade-offs is not a silver bullet, it can help you to make an informed decision that suits your needs. 

The STEAM framework is a mnemonic shortcut to remember your most important assets. It stands for:

* **S**upport : Your social capital. The help of others, whom you can call upon to assist you in your endeavours or to provide you with advice. 
  This can be in the form of a mentor, a coach, a friend, or a colleague.
* **T**ime : The amount of time you have available to invest in activities. The baseline is similar for everyone, as we all have 24 hours in a
  day. How we spend this time, is what makes the difference.
* **E**nergy : How energetic you feel. This can be influenced by your physical and mental health, as well as your emotional state.
  It is important to be aware of your energy levels, as they can influence your ability to undertake tasks, your performance, and the quality of
  your work.
* **A**ttention : How much focus you can apply to any given task. Roughly speaking, this is your ability to filter out distractions and
  be engaged with the task at hand.
* **M**oney : Your financial assets, the amount of funds you have to invest in activities, products, or services.

Short for Domain Driven Design. (from [GlossaryTech](https://glossarytech.com/search/results?phrase=DDD.html))
Domain-Driven Design is a set of principles and schemes aimed at creating optimal systems of objects. Reduced to the

establishes a link between the real conditions of the products application area and the code.

## I

### IDE

Short for Integrated Development Environment.
An application that helps you to develop software, by combining useful features and libraries into one single
application. These IDEs usually allow you to run your tests and code without needing to leave the comfort of your
development environment.

## J

### Jargon

_"The specialized language of a trade, profession, or similar group, especially when viewed as difficult to understand
by outsiders."_. Its goal is to make the exchange of information more efficient by giving specific names to things that
are relevant to the in-group. It is said that the Inuit have over thirty words to differentiate between different types
of snow. Other professions, such as software developers, strongly rely on metaphors to refer to technical concepts.

## K

### Paradigm

A _"paradigm"_ is a fancy word for "point of view". It is the belief system that you hold and use to make sense
of what is happening around you. You can look at it as walking around in an unknown city,
armed with a town map. If the map is not sufficiently detailed, you will find yourself ending up in the wrong place.
You might even end up driving into a lake if the map is inaccurate, digital, and talks to you.

### Pattern language

[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language): A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of
patterns, each describing a problem, and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of
expertise.

### Pragmatic

The word _'Pragmatic'_ originally means "skilled in business". You can interpret this as thinking about the added
benefit (return on investment) of an action before deciding to do it.
A pragmatist will take pieces from various toolsets and methodologies, and apply them to the problem at hand only if it
makes sense to use them. This means that even if a new software architecture is hip and trendy,
you would look at the issue you are trying to solve first and see if the new approach is worth doing.

## R

### ROI

Short for 'return on investment'.
A concept originating from the financial sector. Described on [this page](/1_Patterns/Productivity/Concepts/HOME#return-on-investment).

## S

### Synthesis

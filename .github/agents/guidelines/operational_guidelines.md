## Files and directories

- Treat `docs/` as the **source of truth** about intent and constraints.
- Use `work/` for:
  - scratch notes
  - progress logs
  - intermediate drafts
- Use `output/` for:
  - generated artifacts ready for human review
- Prefer small, incremental changes over large rewrites.

## Rules

- Do not modify files under `docs/` unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer creating new files in `work/` or `output/` over rewriting existing ones without context.
- Keep output structured and easy to diff.
- Always reference relevant guidelines before executing tasks.
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you are a specialist agent: NEVER exceed your specific role's scope.

## Style Guidelines

- Reuse existing templates and patterns (`docs/templates/`) whenever possible.
- Adhere to the writing guidelines in the `docs/styleguide/` directory.
- Use clear, concise language. Maintain a calm and professional tone.
- Follow existing style conventions in code and documentation.
- Content over Hype: Avoid buzzwords and jargon unless necessary.

  section1:
    title: Making sense of advice
    subtitle: the trouble with "best practices" is they never seem to work
    text: >
      We tend to learn a great deal about a wide variety of topics. Yet, from time to time, we are stumped by how elegantly or easily
      someone solves a certain problem. You are left wondering why you have not been tackling similar problems in the same way. It could have saved you
      vast amounts of frustration if only you had known earlier. <br />
      Why did you not know? Why did you not see the solution? Why did you not apply the same technique? 
      <br /><br />
      The answer is simple: you did not know it existed.  
      <br />No one told you about it. No one shared their knowledge with you.  
      <br />Or maybe they did, but you did not understand it. Or you did not see the value in it.
      <br /><br />
      Sharing knowledge can be challenging because people often speak different "languages" when it comes to ideas. 
      Using a structured approach helps us better express and understand concepts, but how do we make sense of the countless frameworks and practices that exist?
      <br /><br />
      And even if we do understand them, how do we know when to apply them? After all, not every tool is right for every job. You are unique, your situation is unique, and so should be your approach.
      <br /><br />
      That's where we come in.<br /> 
      This knowledge base will help you make sense of the vast amount of information out there, so you can focus on what matters most to you.
  section2:
    title: Yet another framework?
    subtitle: Not quite. Here's what makes us different.

    features:
    - title: Focus on practical use
      text: Rather than stick to theory, we aim to help you put what you learn into effect as quickly as possible. By focussing on when techniques and ideas are valuable, you will understand when to apply an idea. And more importantly, when not to apply it.
    - title: Terminology explained
      text: The amount of jargon used when discussing specialized techniques and technology can be overwhelming to newcomers. This publication helps you get acquainted with them so you know what people are talking about.
    - title: Resources & Background information
      text: Recommended background reading, in case you want to dig deeper into certain topics. As with all content here, we focus on showing what is in it for you.
  section3:
    title: Learn. Grow. Improve.
    subtitle: discover new ideas and techniques to help you excel
    text: >
      Imagine the thrill of discovering new ideas and techniques that will help you excel at the things you do every day.
      Whether you're already working in a technical role or just starting out, there's always more to learn and explore.
      Either way, we've got something for you.  
      <br />  
      
      In this knowledge base, you'll discover practical insights and valuable tips from experts who have dedicated themselves to mastering their craft.
      By reading on, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the topics that interest you and learn new ways to take steps towards achieving your goals and
      becoming the best you can be.    
      <br />
      <br />
      
      So why not give it a try? Dive in and see how far you can go.

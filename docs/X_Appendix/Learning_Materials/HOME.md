# Learning_Materials

There are so many awesome learning materials that the simple act of finding something
to read is challenging in and of itself. The list below is a curated index of knowledge resources,
including but not limited to:

- books
- articles
- videos
- websites and tools

Each entry is to be accompanied by a short description. Thus giving you an idea of what it is about, and why it may be useful to you.
If you want to contribute to this list, please take a look at the [contributing guide](https://github.com/sddevelopment-be/penguin-pragmatic-patterns/blob/5840ce70dc4d5f1663cbcff5ef895df1a0b85aff/CONTRIBUTING.md).

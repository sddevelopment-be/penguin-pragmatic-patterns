## Dreyfus model of skill acquisition

> Every journey begins with one step in the right direction. In order to know the direction to take, it is important to know where you are at right now.
>
> ~ paraphrasing Sun Tzu

### Description of Pattern

The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition is a very formalized model, that defines 5 distinct steps of mastery.  
As a learner progresses from left to right, their way of using the skill in question changes.
Even more interesting is that they start thinking in different ways.

### Usage

#### Tailoring coaching approach to the learners skill level

In general, the more experienced one becomes, the more they start internalizing a concept of "the bigger picture".
Inexperienced practitioners of a skill are pleased when someone provides them with clear-cut instructions, especially if they've heard applying these instructions will lead to certain success.
Adapt your coaching and teachings styles to the needs of the learner.

### Compatible with

- Most incremental improvement techniques
- Self-reflection patterns
- Personal knowledge management

## Shu Ha Ri

Shu Ha Ri is a Japanese martial art concept that is used to describe the stages of learning on the path to mastery.

### Description of pattern

> When we learn or train in something, we pass through the stages of shu, ha, and ri. These stages are explained as follows. In shu, we
> repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to these forms
> with no deviation. Next, in the stage of ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In
> this process the forms may be broken and discarded. Finally, in ri, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative
> technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires, unhindered while not overstepping laws.  
> ~ sensei Seishiro

![Shu Ha Ri ><](./shuhari_kanji.jpg)

#### Shu 守: Obey / Protect

You are learning the fundamentals, following the traditions and techniques that are passed down to you. Learning happens by mimicking your
superiors, and repetition of the forms you were taught. You do not deviate from the instructions you were given

#### Ha 破: Detach / Digress

You know when to bend or break the traditions that were passed down to you. You begin to explore and innovate.

#### Ri 離: Leave / Transcend

You are in a state of flow, not thinking about techniques or principles. You act instinctively, decisive, and effortless.

### Context

### Drivers

It is hard to uphold commitments (to yourself), it is equally hard to know when not to

#### Enablers

* We (generally) want to do what is good for ourselves, those close to us, and the people we care about
* There is a cost of choice while working with limited resources: choosing to invest your resources (time, energy, money, health) into an
  endeavour automatically makes it unavailable for investment elsewhere.  
* We can [condition ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) by stating declarations of intent in _"When X happens, then I will Y"_. This [priming](https://en.
  wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_priming) making it easier to act in the way we want to. 
* The TOC teaches us that holding too much work-in-progress reduces our ability to be effective.
* Our mental capacity is limited. When we spend too much time fretting over the things we ought to do, there is little room to work on the things we are doing.

#### Deterrents

* People can pressure us into doing things we would rather not do
* Sometimes we take the path of least resistance, even if it leads to a bad situation
* We are not purely rational beings: The feelings of _"loss"_ and _"failure"_ are not pleasant ones, as humans are hardwired to struggle
  for survival. We are also creatures of habit, favoring known situations over unknown ones.
* We feel a sense of shame when stopping. Our culture has though us that __"quiters never win, and winners never quit"__. 
* We are generally not great at knowing our limits.
* Goals are extremely motivating, but can push us well beyond our limits.
    * This is illustrated by marathon runners getting severally unwell
      and [still continuing the race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_marathon_fatalities), people dying while [climbing
      mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_died_climbing_Mount_Everest).
* Being too flexible in guarding your boundaries. When you make a habbit of going beyong your limit, this is what will be expected of you by yourself and others.

### Solution

* Before starting a task clearly define what `possitive evolution`/`success` means, also clearly define `negative impact`/`warning signals`.
* Set a hard limit on what you are willing to sacrifice in order to try and reach your goal.
    * make these as concrete as possible, similar to using SMART goals.
    * Focus on specifying your limits in various areas: financial, physical, mental, moral, time-bound, ...
* STOP IMMEDIATLY if you cross this threshold.
* When you are working on a commitment you made to someone else, be upfront about how far you are willing to go in order to achieve it.
    * People might still be dissapointed you back out, but since you acted with honesty and integrity, no blame should be attributed to you.

Rather than only focussing on tracking progress, it is wise to also keep tabs on the cost it is inducing into your life or organisation.
This is important if you want to evaluate the ROI of an approach. If you notice you are sacrificing too much of what is dear to you: stop striving to reach that particular goal.
In order to better cope with the dissapointment of "needing to give up", it helps to see most endeavours as experiments rather than "do-or-die" type of deals.

In the end, reaching your goals at all costs is usually not really worth it.

### Measuring success

> [!NOTE]
> How do we know if we applied the pattern succesfully? What are our _'red flags'_ that should

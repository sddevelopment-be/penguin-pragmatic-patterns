## Productivity Articles

This section contains a list of articles that were written by either myself or others 
and added with their permission. These articles can be opinionated pieces, additional context, 
or specific case-studies.

### List of Articles

| Article | Type | Description |
|---|---|--|
| Agility and Craftsmanship | Opinion piece | This article is more of a reflection on observations that I have made over the years. It includes a brief history of the agile software development movement, and how these ideas and concepts are often deluted when they are applied naively in real development teams with actual people.  |

# Practices

## Define breaking conditions on your (self-)commitments

### Context

### Drivers

It is hard to uphold commitments (to yourself), it is equally hard to know when not to

#### Enablers

* We (generally) want to do what is good for ourselves, those close to us, and the people we care about
* There is a cost of choice while working with limited resources: choosing to invest your resources (time, energy, money, health) into an
  endeavour automatically makes it unavailable for investment elsewhere.  
* We can [condition ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) by stating declarations of intent in _"When X happens, then I will Y"_. This [priming](https://en.
  wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_priming) making it easier to act in the way we want to. 
* The TOC teaches us that holding too much work-in-progress reduces our ability to be effective.
* Our mental capacity is limited. When we spend too much time fretting over the things we ought to do, there is little room to work on the things we are doing.

#### Deterrents

* People can pressure us into doing things we would rather not do
* Sometimes we take the path of least resistance, even if it leads to a bad situation
* We are not purely rational beings: The feelings of _"loss"_ and _"failure"_ are not pleasant ones, as humans are hardwired to struggle
  for survival. We are also creatures of habit, favoring known situations over unknown ones.
* We feel a sense of shame when stopping. Our culture has though us that __"quiters never win, and winners never quit"__. 
* We are generally not great at knowing our limits.
* Goals are extremely motivating, but can push us well beyond our limits.
    * This is illustrated by marathon runners getting severally unwell
      and [still continuing the race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_marathon_fatalities), people dying while [climbing
      mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_died_climbing_Mount_Everest).
* Being too flexible in guarding your boundaries. When you make a habbit of going beyong your limit, this is what will be expected of you by yourself and others.

### Solution

* Before starting a task clearly define what `possitive evolution`/`success` means, also clearly define `negative impact`/`warning signals`.
* Set a hard limit on what you are willing to sacrifice in order to try and reach your goal.
    * make these as concrete as possible, similar to using SMART goals.
    * Focus on specifying your limits in various areas: financial, physical, mental, moral, time-bound, ...
* STOP IMMEDIATLY if you cross this threshold.
* When you are working on a commitment you made to someone else, be upfront about how far you are willing to go in order to achieve it.
    * People might still be dissapointed you back out, but since you acted with honesty and integrity, no blame should be attributed to you.

Rather than only focussing on tracking progress, it is wise to also keep tabs on the cost it is inducing into your life or organisation.
This is important if you want to evaluate the ROI of an approach. If you notice you are sacrificing too much of what is dear to you: stop striving to reach that particular goal.
In order to better cope with the dissapointment of "needing to give up", it helps to see most endeavours as experiments rather than "do-or-die" type of deals.

In the end, reaching your goals at all costs is usually not really worth it.

##### Changing carreers / starting a business

by: __Stijn Dejongh__

One of the concerns of leaving a comfortable employment situation, and trading it for a highly uncertain one, is that you could end up without an income.
While this is certainly a concern, most people have more leeway than they might realize. 

At one point, I was considering switching from a position of full-time employment to becoming a self-employed freelance software developer. 
For the duration of my entire life up until that point, I had tried to be financially sensible, not taking too large risks in order to avoid a reduction in luxury.
This had left me with quite a hefty sum of money in my bank account. For the next month or two, I kept close tabs on where my expenses went. Most of it was allocated to food, drink, technical books, and entertainment. With this data in hand, I calculated that it would take about 2 years before I completely ran out of money.

Obviously, this was not an acceptable future to me, so I rethought the situation to be more of an experiment.
Then I asked myself: "How much of my money am I willing to pay to know whether or not this is a viable way of life for me?". 
Turns out what I was willing to spend came down to about 4 months of living expenses. 
Considering I needed some margin if I were to go back to working as a full-time employee, I gave myself 3 months to start working as a freelancer.
This means I set myself a limit, a breaking condition, before I quit my job. The condition was: "If I do not have a signed multi-month freelance contract within the next three months, I will abandon the plan and focus on finding stable employment again".

I discussed my intent with my then-fiancee (now wife), as it also affected her. She was okay with delaying our long term plans with about one year in case I did not reach my intended goal.
This gave me two things. First of all, it helped reassure me that I was not doing harm to the people I cared about. Secondly, it served as a sanity-check of my plans.
If my goal was completely unrealistic, she would have undoubtedly told me at that point.

## Free your mind: the external memory


### Context

![./free-mind.gif >](./free-mind.gif)

Human memory is [extremely lossy](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/human-memory). We are better equipped for creative,
constructive thinking than for storing factual information. Focus is [easily disrupted](https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching/).
It makes practical and economic sense to try and reduce the impact of _"forgetfulness"_ and being _"pulled out of your flow"_.
Try and find a way to free up your headspace and thinking power for the endeavors that actually matter.

### Drivers

* Context switches hurt your productivity
* Modern systems and activity are too large to pit in your brain completely
* The more you have to keep in memory, the more likely you will forget something
* Having a mental task list becomes exhausting after a while
* We wish to be able to easily report progress when queried
* Hand-overs take a lot of time and effort
* Computers are great at remembering stuff

### Solution

* Use a technological or physical aid to keep track of your ideas and notes
* Make sure you **trust** your external brain, in order to free head-space
* Revisit your notes regularly
* Favor text-based formats, as they are easier to version, maintain and port
* Whatever system you use, make sure it is easily accessible, and non-disruptive to your primary focus

### Examples

There are many online (free and paid) systems that offer you a way to store your thoughts.
Some of them are listed below in the _references_ section.

You can use a simple text-based system to keep track of your thoughts, or ToDo items.
I personally prefer using these text-based systems as they allow for easier cross-platform portability, akd avoid you being locked in to a
single vendor solution. This entire knowledge base can be seen as one big "external brain".

### Personal testimonials / opinions

#### Stijn's developer logs

Working on enterprise projects tends to be a continuous struggle against interruptions, pivots, and moving targets.
In order to stay on track, it helps to keep track of your actions and thoughts.
The best way I have found so far is to keep track of my actions on different projects by including short developer logs inside the code repositories.
This allows me to come back to a project that has been on ice for a while with relatively low friction.
In addition to this, I try and keep a day-to-day running count of what happened during any given day. This is done in a separate log, which I try to write at the end of the day.

> [!TIP]
> One of my favorite ways of note-taking while working on a software project is to add a _`dev_notes`_ directory to my codebase.
> For short-lived projects or changes, I tend to add this file to the `.gitignore` configuration of my repository as to not muck up the
> workspace of my colleagues. For more long-term or collaborative projects, consider creating a dedicated repository to host all of your
> developer notes. You can get creative with `symbolic links` to make these folders show up in your codebase regardless of their
> physical location.

## Organize your workflow

### Context

### Drivers

* You want to finalize your tasks and "get things done"
* People are often distracted by their own thoughts
* Multitasking is hard. Our brains work better if we can compartmentalize between different modes of thinking
* Our memories are very lossy. We tend to forget about things all the time
* Standard To-Do lists have no readily available means of prioritizing items
* Having too many things on our mind stresses us out

### Solution

Use a personalozed productivity flow, using whatever tool you feel comfortable in.
For some, this will be a pen-and-paper system. Others prefer to leverage their digital prowess and lifestyle to have
theis productivity
tool available all the time[^1]. One of the most popular personal productivity methods is called the _"Getting things
done"_ method[^2].

![./task-flow.png ><](./task_flow.png ':size=684')

**Whatever method you choose, make sure to:**

* Have a specific location to dump out your thoughts
* You should **trust** your tools. Peace of mind only happens when you are convinced your ideas and todos are stored
  reliably
* Regularly review your braindump tool and curate it. Some of your ideas will be crappy. Get rid of them.
* Categorize and Prioritize your thoughts **after** you have collected them
    * The Eisenhouwer Matrix is an excellent technique to do this
    * differentiate between "things to remember" and "things that require action"
    * assign "due dates" if able

#### Eisenhouwer priority Matrix

![./eis_matrix.png <](./eis_matrix.png ':size=364')

Organize your action items according to:

* their **importance**: actions can be either `important` or `unimportant`
* their **urgency**: these are either `urgent` or `not urgent`

This leaves you with a nice 2-by-2 grid in which to place your actionable items[^3].
Each grid section corresponds to a specific way to handle the action items contained within:

- **eliminate of ignore** the things that are `unimportant` and `not urgent`. Because _Who cares abut these anyway?_ The
  items in this
  quadrant are better known as "distractions" or "busy work".
- **delegate** the `unimportant` and `urgent`stuff. Something should be done about them fast, but you probably don't
  need to be the
  person working on them.
- **plan / schedule** the items that are `important` and `not urgent`. These are the things that you would really like
  to do, but never
  seem to get around to doing. Setting a specific date on which you will act upon these items will help you get them
  done eventually. Just
  make sure to stick to your schedule.
- **Do these NOW!**: `important` and `urgent`... what are you waiting for? Start working on these immediately. Just make
  sure these
  things are important to YOU and you are not being swayed by someone else's urgency.

### Examples

#### Personal productivity flow using MS online tooling

In recent years, microsoft has pivotted towards providing office-as-a-service applications.
Most if these can be easily incorporated into your personal workflow. Having everything online makes it easier to be
productive,
without losing your mobility.

## OPERAs method

### Problem

How do you make structured progress towards a specific overarching goal?

### Intent
- Your operational process is more structured
- You can apply different approaches to each step of the process
- You can keep tabs on the status of various goals and objectives, using the step names as status indicators

### Contextual forces

- You have a need to keep tabs on the status of various goals and objectives, by using the step names as status indicators
- having a clear idea of progress made, when combined with the KPI pattern
- split big goals into bite-sized chunks
- stay committed to your goals without feeling like you are drowning in a never ending cycle of irrelevant 'side quests

### Solution

![The OPERAs flow >](./OPERAs.png ':size=424')

The OPERAS mental model is a description of the flow you go through when advancing a task from "TODO" status to "DONE". A task can be of any
size, and can range from 'build a house' to 'do the dishes'.

- define a goal you wish to work towards
      - It is best to describe this goal in a measurable way, so tracking progress is easier in the future
- when working towards a goal, starting from a 'to do' state, you perform a series of steps in order
      - for some processes, a few of these steps could require very minimal effort.
- the acronym 'OPERAS' stands for the main steps in this model's flow:
      - Orientate
      - Prepare
      - Execute
      - Reflect
      - Adapt
      - Synthesize

#### Detailed description

<div class="accordion">
<details>
<summary>1. Orientate</summary>
<p>
Just like when finding your way through unknown territory, it is best to take in the landscape and plot your next sensible move forward.
The idea is to think about the goal you wish to reach and figure out if there are any smaller milestones to reach in order to work towards your goal.
An example: if you were to want to have a clean house, you could divide this into the cleaning of each room, doing the dishes, and taking care of the garden.
Each of these sub-goals is a milestone to be reached in order to get towards your desired outcome.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Prepare</summary>

<p>
The preparation step is where you gather the tools needed to perform the action. These can either be physical assets, pieces of knowledge, or people whose assistance you need to enlist. This step is the transition between the more strategical aspects of your process to the practical execution of one of the milestones. Ask yourself: _"What do I need to get the started?"_, and then gather the resources needed to go ahead.

> [!WARNING]
> The most common risk in this phase of the process is to over-analyze the situation. This anti-pattern is known
> as _"[analysis paralysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analysisparalysis.asp)"_ and is extremely detrimental to making progress.
> Be sure you only identify the minimal set of required resources you need to START progressing. You can always loop back, and search for
> additional resources when they are needed.

> [!NOTE]
> An example: You wish to do the dishes, so you check that the dishwasher is not obviously broken.
> Then you go around the house and gather all the dirty utensils and plates you can find. The preparation step ends with a pile of dirty
> dishes on your kitchen counter.
</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Execute </summary>

<p>
You set out and do the task you intended to do. This is the operational phase of the process. You work on completion of the next sensible step to reach your first milestone.

> [!INFO]
> An example: You load the dirty plates and cups into the dishwasher.
</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Reflect</summary>

<p>
At this point, you have finished working on one of the sub-tasks you set out to complete. Either the result was satisfactory or it was not. Either way, there are likely things that went well, and things that did not go well. Use these experiences as a learning mechanic to improve the way you approach tasks in the future.
This is also an excellent time to revisit the original outline of the task distribution to see how to proceed.

> [!INFO]
> An example: You were not able to do all the dishes as they would not all fit into the dishwasher. You also realized 40% of the time you 
> spent on doing the dishes was used to collect the dirty plates and cups from all around the house.
</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Adapt</summary>

<p>
After reflecting on the actions taken and their outcomes, you can choose to adapt your approach using the insights you have gathered. This can either mean changing your approach entirely, or making small adjustments to the operational execution of your task.
An example: You could wash some of your dishes by hand, as it will not take significant time to do so. Waiting for the dishwasher to complete before loading the next batch of dishes would just move the problem to the future.

<summary>6. Synthesize</summary>

<p>
After a milestone is reached, you can choose to synthesize the lessons you learned from this process. You could write down some key insights for future reference. 
In a social context, you might even share your insights with others, so they can learn from your experience.

Note that indirect learning is not for everyone, and others might repeat some of the mistakes you made. Even so, armed with your story, they
might know a few coping strategies to resolve the situation in case it goes bad.

## Pomodoro focus

### Problem statement

You are distracted by various inputs from your environment, causing you to not finish tasks you set out to do.

### Intent

* Your tasks get finished more often, or at least move to a point where (part of) the work can be considered  __"completed"__.
* Your days stop feeling like you are running all over the place without accomplishing much.
* You feel less resistance to starting a task.

### Contextual forces

#### Enablers

* You wish to complete tasks to be best of your ability, and as fast as circumstances allow.
* The tasks you perform require your attention, and take sufficiently long to accomplish.
* You can split your tasks into smaller parts, each of which add some value on their own accord.
* You have some autonomy on how you allocate your time.

#### Deterrents

* Your main activity requires you to switch between various tasks quickly.
* The tasks you are performing often take a few moments of your time and do not require focus.
* Your environment rewards __looking__ busy over __being__ busy.

### Solution

* Set a timer[^0] for a fixed amount of time. This timebox is called a "pomodoro".
    * Commonly, 25 minutes is used as a base value.
* Distance yourself from all distractions, and work on one task until the timer notifies you.
* After completing a timebox, take a 5 minute break.
* Set a new timer, and repeat.
* After completing four iterations, take an extended break.

For tasks that require a long time to complete, decide beforehand how much time you will invest in it now.
It helps to specify a number of pomodoro's that you will devote to working on the task. You stop when the task is done, or your tinme allocation
runs out. Whichever comes first.

> [!TIP]
> The pomodoro technique works well if you splits your tasks down into smaller chunks that can be accomplished within a single pomodoro.

### Rationale

__"The hardest part is getting started."__ Reducing the resistance to start a task can help practitioners to overcome the inertia.
The pomodoro technique aims to achieve this by introducing the reassurance that the end is in sight.
Rather than committing to fully complete an endeavour, a practitioner is commiting to work on a certain task for a fixed period of time.

Adding a certain element of gamification, and measurability, to the process helps motivate people to work towards their goals more frequently
and consistently.

### Examples

#### A command line pomodoro timer

If you do not have a mechanical timer available, you can use your computer's terminal to act the part.
The script below, published by Byron Salty [on github](https://github.com/byronsalty/pom/blob/main/pom) is an excelent way of doing this.
On MacBooks, the `say` command makes your computer talk to you.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  let min=25 
else
  let min=$1
fi
echo "Waiting ${min} minutes"

for i in $(seq 1 $min)
do
  sleep 60  
  let rem=min-i
  echo -ne "${rem} minutes remaining\\r"
done
echo ""

msg="Pomodoro completare"
echo $msg
say -v Luca $msg
```

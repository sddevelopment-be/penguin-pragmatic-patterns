## Divide and Conquer

### Context

> [!STUB]
> Add a textual description of the context in which this pattern can be applied

### Drivers

* Small pieces of logic are easier to reason about. They are bite-sized chunks that we can fit in our heads completely.

> [!STUB]
> A bullet list explaining why this pattern makes sense,
> try and be as objective as possible here

#### Enablers

> [!STUB]
> Contextual factors that increase the chances of successfully implementing the pattern

#### Deterrents

> [!STUB]
> Contextual factors that decrease the chances of successfully implementing the pattern

### Solution

* Starting from higher level desiderata, we can identify components that will act as small pieces of the puzzle. Once we
  combine them, they should deliver us our intended result. If each of these pieces does what it needs to do, our result is more likely to be
  correct.

### Measuring success

> [!STUB]
> How do we know if we applied the pattern succesfully? What are our _'red flags'_ that should
> trigger an adaption of the style of application?

# Agents Quickstart

This folder contains the shared instructions for all agents in this repository.

The idea:

- **Generic guidelines live here** (`.github/agents/*.md`).
- **Repo-specific rules live in** `docs/` (`VISION.md`, `specific_guidelines.md`).
- **Specialist agents live in** `.github/agents/*.agent.md`.

Agents should always combine both: generic + repo-specific.

---

## 1. Files in this folder

- `general_guidelines.md`  
  How agents should generally behave (tone, safety, collaboration, etc.).

- `operational_guidelines.md`  
  How agents should work inside this repository:
  - where to read from
  - where to write
  - what to treat as authoritative

- `bootstrap.md`  
  How a new agent should start when it has no prior context.

- `rehydrate.md`  
  How an agent should recover context and resume existing work.

- `*.agent.md`  
  Predefined roles (planner, researcher, implementer, …).  
  Each file documents:
  - the purpose of the specialist
  - typical inputs and outputs
  - when to hand over to another agent

## 2. Customizing this template

When you create a new repository from this template:

1. Update `docs/VISION.md` to describe what this repo is trying to achieve.
2. Update `docs/specific_guidelines.md` with any hard rules or constraints.
3. Review the specialists in `.github/agents/*.agent.md`:
   - Delete ones you will not use.
   - Rename or adjust their responsibilities.
4. Optionally, add your own specialist files for your domain.

## 3. Using Issue Templates for Agent Tasks

This repository includes specialized issue templates that streamline agent-driven workflows:

### Bootstrap Repository Template
- **File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bootstrap-repo.yml`
- **Purpose:** Configure repository vision, guidelines, and agent context
- **Assigned to:** Bootstrap Bill (`agent:bootstrap-bill` label)
- **Use when:** Setting up a new repository or updating vision and operational guidelines

The template captures:
- Repository vision and scope
- Technology stack and constraints
- Communication preferences
- Agent roles and responsibilities
- Reference materials

### Create New Agent Template
- **File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/create-new-agent.yml`
- **Purpose:** Request creation of a new specialized agent
- **Assigned to:** Manager Mike (`agent:manager-mike` label)
- **Use when:** Need a new specialized agent for a specific domain

The template captures:
- Agent name and purpose
- Primary focus and specialization
- Success criteria and tools needed
- Collaboration protocols
- Reference materials (stored in `docs/references/` if requested)

### Agent Ownership Labels

Issues are automatically routed using agent-specific labels defined in `.github/labels.yml`:
- `agent:bootstrap-bill` - Repository structure and scaffolding
- `agent:manager-mike` - Coordination and routing
- `agent:writer-editor` - Documentation and content
- `agent:architect` - System design
- And 11 more specialist labels...

## 4. How agents should combine these documents

When you configure an agent, instruct it to:

1. Read `docs/VISION.md`.
2. Read `docs/specific_guidelines.md`.
3. Read `.github/agents/guidelines/general_guidelines.md`.
4. Read `.github/agents/guidelines/operational_guidelines.md`.
5. Read its own specialist definition defined in `.github/agents/*.agent.md`.
6. If resuming work, follow `.github/agents/guidelines/rehydrate.md`.
7. If starting new work, follow `.github/agents/guidelines/bootstrap.md`.

This keeps behaviour consistent while letting each repo define its own purpose.

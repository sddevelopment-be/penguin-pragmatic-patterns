## Context

## Drivers

It is hard to uphold commitments (to yourself), it is equally hard to know when not to

### Enablers

* We (generally) want to do what is good for ourselves, those close to us, and the people we care about
* There is a cost of choice while working with limited resources: choosing to invest your resources (time, energy, money, health) into an
  endeavour automatically makes it unavailable for investment elsewhere.  
* We can [condition ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) by stating declarations of intent in _"When X happens, then I will Y"_. This [priming](https://en.
  wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_priming) making it easier to act in the way we want to. 
* The TOC teaches us that holding too much work-in-progress reduces our ability to be effective.
* Our mental capacity is limited. When we spend too much time fretting over the things we ought to do, there is little room to work on the things we are doing.

### Deterrents

* People can pressure us into doing things we would rather not do
* Sometimes we take the path of least resistance, even if it leads to a bad situation
* We are not purely rational beings: The feelings of _"loss"_ and _"failure"_ are not pleasant ones, as humans are hardwired to struggle
  for survival. We are also creatures of habit, favoring known situations over unknown ones.
* We feel a sense of shame when stopping. Our culture has though us that __"quiters never win, and winners never quit"__. 
* We are generally not great at knowing our limits.
* Goals are extremely motivating, but can push us well beyond our limits.
    * This is illustrated by marathon runners getting severally unwell
      and [still continuing the race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_marathon_fatalities), people dying while [climbing
      mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_died_climbing_Mount_Everest).
* Being too flexible in guarding your boundaries. When you make a habbit of going beyong your limit, this is what will be expected of you by yourself and others.

## Solution

* Before starting a task clearly define what `possitive evolution`/`success` means, also clearly define `negative impact`/`warning signals`.
* Set a hard limit on what you are willing to sacrifice in order to try and reach your goal.
    * make these as concrete as possible, similar to using SMART goals.
    * Focus on specifying your limits in various areas: financial, physical, mental, moral, time-bound, ...
* STOP IMMEDIATLY if you cross this threshold.
* When you are working on a commitment you made to someone else, be upfront about how far you are willing to go in order to achieve it.
    * People might still be dissapointed you back out, but since you acted with honesty and integrity, no blame should be attributed to you.

Rather than only focussing on tracking progress, it is wise to also keep tabs on the cost it is inducing into your life or organisation.
This is important if you want to evaluate the ROI of an approach. If you notice you are sacrificing too much of what is dear to you: stop striving to reach that particular goal.
In order to better cope with the dissapointment of "needing to give up", it helps to see most endeavours as experiments rather than "do-or-die" type of deals.

In the end, reaching your goals at all costs is usually not really worth it.

### Use Cases / Testimonials [Optional]

#### Changing carreers / starting a business

by: __Stijn Dejongh__

One of the concerns of leaving a comfortable employment situation, and trading it for a highly uncertain one, is that you could end up without an income.
While this is certainly a concern, most people have more leeway than they might realize. 

At one point, I was considering switching from a position of full-time employment to becoming a self-employed freelance software developer. 
For the duration of my entire life up until that point, I had tried to be financially sensible, not taking too large risks in order to avoid a reduction in luxury.
This had left me with quite a hefty sum of money in my bank account. For the next month or two, I kept close tabs on where my expenses went. Most of it was allocated to food, drink, technical books, and entertainment. With this data in hand, I calculated that it would take about 2 years before I completely ran out of money.

Obviously, this was not an acceptable future to me, so I rethought the situation to be more of an experiment.
Then I asked myself: "How much of my money am I willing to pay to know whether or not this is a viable way of life for me?". 
Turns out what I was willing to spend came down to about 4 months of living expenses. 
Considering I needed some margin if I were to go back to working as a full-time employee, I gave myself 3 months to start working as a freelancer.
This means I set myself a limit, a breaking condition, before I quit my job. The condition was: "If I do not have a signed multi-month freelance contract within the next three months, I will abandon the plan and focus on finding stable employment again".

I discussed my intent with my then-fiancee (now wife), as it also affected her. She was okay with delaying our long term plans with about one year in case I did not reach my intended goal.
This gave me two things. First of all, it helped reassure me that I was not doing harm to the people I cared about. Secondly, it served as a sanity-check of my plans.
If my goal was completely unrealistic, she would have undoubtedly told me at that point.

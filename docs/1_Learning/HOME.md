From the moment us humans started banding together in semi=permanent groups, we have taught each other skills, tricks, experiences, 
and so on. THis means that over the ages, a lot of research has been done on just how people are able to learn and acquire new skills.

Occasionally,we all feel the urge to know how good we are at something. Particularly motivated individuals might even want to figure out how to become better at the things they
enjoy doing. In this chapter, we will visit some concept, techniques, and exercises that help us in this quest for mastery.

To help us get our bearings before embarking on this journey, let's first take a look at how we can define the concept of "knowledge".
With some luck, we can create a mental model to serve as our map. After all, moving quickly in the wrong direction only removes us from our 
intended destination  faster.

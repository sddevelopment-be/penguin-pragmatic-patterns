## About this publication

A learning and development knowledge base, aimed to share knowledge with other technical professionals.
The docs section of this repository is somewhat of a "personal wiki". It contains knowledge and information that has
been collected from various sources, and is extended with some personal interpretations and
experiences of the author.

> [!NOTE]
> As this knowledge base will likely remain a work in progress for quite a while,
> not all content will be refined. It is advisable to check out the [Changelog](/X_Appendix/HOME?id=changelog) in order
> to see what has been
> changed recently.

### Purpose

As we live our lives, we tend to learn a great deal about a wide variety of topics.
From time to time we are stumped by how elegant, or easy, someone solves a certain problem. And you are left wondering
why you have not been tackling similar problems in the same way. It could have saved you vast amounts of frustration, if
only you had known earlier.

The aim of this catalog is to bundle some little nuggets of enlightenment these "aha"-moments tend to deliver.
The hope is that someone, somewhere learns something that makes their lives a bit more enjoyable.

### Intended Audience

This knowledge base is intended for people that are interested in improving theis current way of working ( or living )
by learning about
alternative approaches. You will likely already be familiar with some ideas in this knowledge base, in which case: feel
free to
move on. If you think we are blabbering and giving bad advice, feel free to leave a comment or suggestion
on the [github page](https://github.com/sddevelopment-be/penguin-pragmatic-patterns).

### Structure

This open knowledge collection is ordered by categories. Each of these categories contains some of the following
resources:

- **A collection of Patterns:** Little snippets of information to inspire you. These can be used as general pieces of
  advice that may or
  may not be applicable to your current situation. In order to maximize theis usefulness, these patterns (or motifs)
  follow a similar
  structure.
- **Articles and short-form information:** These sections contain a list of articles that were written by either myself
  or others and added
  with their permission. These articles can be opinionated pieces, additional context, or specific case-studies.
- **Resources and Reviews :** Additional information relating to a topic, that do not quite fit the other sections.
  These might include
  book recommendations, tutorials, tool recommendations, etc.

A set of concepts and common abbreviations can be found in the [glossary](/X_Appendix/Glossary/HOME).

Acting as my editor, please proofread this pattern. It is intended to be used in my online knowledge base.  
The pattern consists of a problem statement, intent, contextual forces (drivers), and a solution as described in the attached template. 
The pattern is written in a conversational tone, and uses British English spelling. 
The format of the pattern is HuGo-enhanced markdown. Assume all footnotes are correctly linked, and all referenced images are present.

Tell me what the core message of the text is in 4 sentences.
Next, give me some feedback on the tone and style of writing.
Next, list any grammar, spelling, or stylistic faults and how to resolve them.

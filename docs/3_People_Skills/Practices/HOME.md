## Walk the talk: act congruently

![Image of pony looking devious, but claiming to be sad about your misfortune. >](./congruence.webp ':size=320')

### Context

Quick! Think of that one person who said something, and then showed they did not mean it by how they were behaving.  
Did you think of someone? Maybe it was hard to choose only one person, as people tend to do this often.

How did you feel about that person afterwards? Do you trust them?
Do you feel they were being honest?   
Or perhaps you think they acted in the most hypocritical way imaginable [^0].

### Drivers

* People tend to remember past interactions and assume future interactions will be similar
* Non-verbal communication, such as body language and actions, tell us more than words ever could
* You come over as trustworthy if you have a history of acting in an honest, and professional manner. Conversely, you
  will be perceived as unreliable if you fail to do so.
* _“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit.”_ ~ Will Durant[^1].
  Neuroscience has proven that our brains _'rewire'_ themselves by repeating actions over and over.
  This is what makes habits, trauma, and false beliefs so hard to break.
* We live and operate in a collaborative society. It is in our own best interest if others are willing to help us out,
  and trust us.
* Occupational burnout can be caused by forcing yourself to act against your beliefs. Research refers to this as _"
  conflicting values"_ or _"loss of agency and control"_ [^2].

#### Enablers

* You have the means to keep track of time, and to take note of the promises you make.

#### Deterrents

> [!NOTE]

### Solution

> Add subsections as you see fit in order to clearly communicate the idea

### Measuring success

> [!NOTE]
> How do we know if we applied the pattern succesfully? What are our _'red flags'_ that should
> trigger an adaption of the style of application?

song goes: _"My dad caught me smoking, and said ´No way!'. Damn hypocrite smokes two packs a day."_

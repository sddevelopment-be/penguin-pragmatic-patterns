# Open Learning Knowledge Base

## Outline

A learning and development knowledge base, aimed to share knowledge with other technical professionals.
The docs section of this repository is somewhat of a "personal wiki".
It contains knowledge and information that has been collected from various sources, and is extended with some personal interpretations and experiences of the author.

> [!NOTE]
> As this knowledge base will likely remain a work in progress for quite a while,
> not all content will be refined. It is advisable to check out the [Changelog](/X_Appendix/HOME?id=changelog) in order to see what has been changed recently. 

## Purpose

As we live our lives, we tend to learn a great deal about a wide variety of topics.
From time to time we are stumped by how elegant, or easy, someone solves a certain problem. And you are left wondering why you have not been tackling similar problems in the same way. It could have saved you vast amounts of frustration, if only you had known earlier.

The aim of this catalog is to bundle some of the little nuggets of enlightenment these "aha"-moments tend to deliver.
The hope is that someone, somewhere learns something that makes their lives a litle bit more enjoyable.

## Intended Audience

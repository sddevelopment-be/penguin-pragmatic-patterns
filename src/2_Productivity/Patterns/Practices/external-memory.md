### Drivers

* The more you have to keep in memory, the more likely you will forget something
* Having a mental task list becomes exhausting after a while
* We wish to be able to easily report porgress whnh queried
* Hand-overs take a lot of time and effort
* Computers are great at remembering stuff

### Solution

* Use a technological or physical aid to keep track of your ideas
* Make sure you **trust** your external brain, in order to free headspace
* Revisit your notes regularly

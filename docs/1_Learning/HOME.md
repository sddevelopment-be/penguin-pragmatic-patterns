Since the dawn of human civilization, we have been sharing knowledge and teaching each other skills to thrive as a species. As a result,
learning has been an essential part of our evolution, and we continue to discover new ways to acquire knowledge and improve our abilities.

In ancient Greece, education was highly valued, and young boys were educated in various subjects such as reading, writing, math, music, and
physical education. The goal was to create well-rounded individuals who could participate in civic life and contribute to society.
Philosophers like Socrates and Plato taught young men in Athens, emphasizing critical thinking and self-examination as important aspects of
education.

For the Romans education was one of the most noblest virtues one could strive towards. As a highly pragmatic society, their focus was on
practical skills, such as public speaking, accounting, and military strategy. Education was seen as a way to advance socially and politically, and
successful Roman politicians were often well-educated orators.

Youths in ancient Japan were similarly instructed, in order to instill a sense of discipline and duty in the young. We all know their samurai as
being fearless in battle, disciplined in their actions, and above all honorable. But did you know this warrior class was also well-versed in
both reading and writing? Similarly to the greek philosophers, and roman writers, the samurai were no stranger to the softer sides of life.
Some of their pondering has been passed through the ages in the form of traditional haiku.

All of these societies regarded the pursuit of knowledge, and the honing of ones innate skills as a moral duty. They believed it was essential
for sharpening the minds and character of their citizens, as well as making them valuable assets capable of contributing to their society in
various ways.

It is not surprise that quite a bit of our thoughts about education find their origins in these ancient traditions.
As an example, the "socratic method" which aims to let pupils figure out answers to their challenges by means of asking the right questions, is
still widely practiced.

At times, we may feel the need to challenge ourselves and assess our level of mastery in a particular area.
Particularly motivated individuals might even strive to further hone their skills. In this chapter, we will explore various concepts, techniques,
and exercises that can aid in this pursuit of expertise.

## What is knowledge?

Before we delve deeper into the specifics of learning, let's first define what we mean by "knowledge" and create a mental map to guide us. With a
clear understanding of our destination, we can avoid going astray and move towards our goals with purpose and direction.

## Definition

Helping Attitudes refer to the various roles or approaches a person can adopt when assisting someone in solving a problem. These roles range from
simply providing a listening presence to diagnosing and prescribing solutions. Each role requires a different level of involvement and
responsibility, and helpers often move between these roles as the situation evolves.

## Key Components

Helping relationships consist of various dynamics where the helper must decide how much involvement and guidance is appropriate.
There are two parties involved in a helping relationship: the helper and the person seeking help.
The helper can adopt different attitudes (or roles) to provide assistance, depending on the situation and the needs of the person being helped
(also known as __'the client'__ ). The flexibility to shift between different **Helping Attitudes** ensures that the help provided is relevant and
adaptive to the client’s needs.

### Power Dynamics

Effective helping relationships require humility and an understanding of power dynamics. The person offering help should
recognize that the person being helped might feel vulnerable or defensive, which can affect how the help is received.
He also discusses the importance of building trust and creating a collaborative atmosphere where both parties are aligned in their goals.

The helper must be aware of their own biases, assumptions, and limitations, as these can influence the quality of the help provided.
Often, the helper’s role is to empower the person seeking help, rather than imposing their own solutions or ideas.
This requires a delicate balance between offering support and guidance while allowing the person being helped to maintain autonomy and ownership
over the problem-solving process.

### Primary Attitudes/Roles

* **Rubber Duck**: In this role, the helper listens and validates without becoming actively involved in solving the problem. The focus is on
  being present and allowing the person to process their thoughts aloud.
* **Process Consultant**: The helper acts as a facilitator, inquiring about the issue and helping the person clarify their thoughts. This role
  involves moderate involvement in the problem-solving process and focuses on guiding the person toward their own conclusions.
* **Crafter**: Here, the helper implements predefined solutions provided by the person being helped. The helper is highly involved but has
  limited control, as they are executing someone else's plan.
* **Doctor**: In this role, the helper takes full responsibility for diagnosing the problem and prescribing a solution. This is a highly
  involved role with significant control over the direction and outcome of the assistance.

### Flexibility and Reversion

One of the core ideas behind effective helping relationships is the helper’s ability to switch between roles based on the dynamics of the
situation. The helper must continuously assess whether their involvement is appropriate and make adjustments as necessary. A critical part of
this flexibility is regularly reverting to the **Process Consultant** role. This role allows the helper to clarify the situation, check for
misunderstandings, or verify their involvement when the context is unclear or progress has stalled.

The **Process Consultant** stance is crucial because it serves as the fallback role in cases of uncertainty or lack of progress. Whether the
helper has been acting as the **Doctor**, **Crafter**, or **Rubber Duck**, they may revert to the **Process Consultant** role to ensure they are
still aligned with the needs of the person they are helping. This re-engagement helps realign the situation, ensuring that any future assistance
provided is relevant and helpful.

The cyclical nature of helping relationships requires the helper to continually adjust their approach. Moving between roles -- whether from **Doctor**
to **Crafter**, or from **Rubber Duck** to **Process Consultant** -- allows the helper to respond to changing dynamics and the evolving
understanding of the problem. The flexibility to shift between these attitudes ensures that the helper remains engaged in a way that is most
useful for the person being assisted.


### Details: Overview of Attitudes

#### Rubber Duck

The **Rubber Duck** role is the least intrusive helping attitude. The helper offers minimal guidance, simply providing a presence and a listening
ear. This role is effective for individuals who benefit from articulating their problems out loud. By allowing the individual to speak freely, they
often arrive at solutions on their own, without active involvement from the helper.

This role is particularly useful when the person seeking help already has the knowledge and skills they need to solve their problem but feels stuck
or overwhelmed. By having a "safe" and non-judgmental listener, they can process their emotions, vent frustrations, or explore ideas without
interference or guidance. The helper acts almost like a therapeutic presence, just being there for the person without imposing expertise, advice, or
facilitation.

#### Process Consultant

The **Process Consultant** serves as a guide, asking questions to clarify the problem and the individual's thought process. This role requires more
involvement than the **Rubber Duck** but maintains a focus on helping the individual arrive at their own conclusions. It’s a reflective stance that
involves listening, questioning, and exploring options without directly solving the problem.

#### Crafter

In the **Crafter** role, the helper takes on an active role in executing a solution, but the control over what to do is still with the person being
helped. The **Crafter** is hands-on, following instructions or implementing agreed-upon actions. The helper's involvement is high in terms of
effort, but the control over decision-making remains low.

#### Doctor

The **Doctor** role represents the highest level of control and involvement. The helper diagnoses the problem, prescribes a solution, and often
takes responsibility for its implementation. This role is suitable when the individual lacks the expertise to understand or solve the problem
themselves. The helper’s knowledge and authority are central to solving the issue.

## Background

### Origin

The concept of Helping Attitudes originates from the work of Edgar Schein, who identified three key roles that helpers typically adopt: Process
Consultant, Doctor, and Crafter (or "Pair of Hands"). Schein emphasized that helping relationships are dynamic and require the helper to be
adaptable. The **Rubber Duck** role expands on Schein’s original framework by recognizing the value of passive listening as an important helping
stance.

### Application

Helping Attitudes are highly relevant in fields such as coaching, consulting, therapy, and even everyday problem-solving. The key to applying these
roles effectively is understanding when each is appropriate and being able to switch between them as needed. For instance, in a business setting, a
manager might first adopt the **Process Consultant** role to clarify a team member's challenge, then transition to the **Crafter** role to help
implement a solution. If the problem becomes more complex, the manager might step into the **Doctor** role to diagnose and prescribe a solution.

In practice, helpers frequently start by asking questions (as a **Process Consultant**) to understand the issue at hand. Depending on the responses,
they may shift to a more directive role (**Doctor**) or simply offer emotional support (**Rubber Duck**). The helper’s ability to move fluidly
between these roles ensures that the assistance provided is effective and appropriately tailored to the evolving needs of the person seeking help.

### Comparisons

Helping Attitudes can be compared to models in coaching and therapy, where different levels of intervention are used based on the client’s needs.
For example:

* **Schein's Original Model:** Schein identified three main roles in helping relationships: Process Consultant, Doctor, and Crafter (or "Pair of
  Hands"). His framework emphasized that the helper must be flexible in switching between these roles depending on the situation. Schein's Process
  Consultant focuses on facilitating the client’s own problem-solving process, which is the most neutral role, similar to a coach. The Doctor role
  involves diagnosing and prescribing solutions, akin to offering direct advice, while the Crafter role involves executing predefined solutions as
  directed by the client. The Rubber Duck role expands on Schein’s original framework, adding a more passive stance of simply listening and
  validating the client, allowing them to work through their own thoughts with minimal input from the helper.

* **Coaching:** In coaching, the Process Consultant role mirrors the coach’s role in asking open-ended questions to guide the coachee toward their
  own solutions. The Doctor role in helping resembles a more directive coaching approach where advice and solutions are provided. Coaching also
  emphasizes the importance of knowing when to step back and allow the coachee to come to their own conclusions, which aligns with the Rubber Duck
  role.

* **Therapy:** In therapy, the Rubber Duck role aligns with non-directive approaches like person-centered therapy, where the therapist offers
  empathy and listening without solving the problem. On the other hand, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) mirrors the Doctor role, where the
  therapist actively diagnoses and prescribes interventions. Therapists, like helpers, must shift between roles, from simply listening, to guiding,
  to providing expert advice or solutions, depending on the situation and the client’s needs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Mentoring a Junior Developer

A junior developer is struggling with a coding problem and seeks help from their mentor. The mentor initially adopts the **Process Consultant**
role, asking the developer to explain their thought process and identify where they think the issue lies. After clarifying the problem, the mentor
shifts into the **Crafter** role, helping the junior developer implement a solution based on the instructions provided. If the problem turns out to
be more complex than expected, the mentor may shift to the **Doctor** role, diagnosing the issue and prescribing a solution.

### Example 2: Supporting a Colleague in Crisis

A colleague is feeling overwhelmed with their workload and asks for support. The helper adopts the **Rubber Duck** role, providing a listening ear
as the colleague vents their frustrations. After validating the colleague's feelings, the helper switches to the **Process Consultant** role, asking
open-ended questions to help the colleague reflect on potential solutions. If necessary, the helper might suggest some concrete actions (**Doctor**)
or offer hands-on assistance (**Crafter**) to help the colleague regain control over their workload.

### Example 3: Cross-Departmental Collaboration

In a large corporation, different departments (e.g., engineering, marketing, and sales) often struggle to collaborate effectively. A facilitator is
brought in to help the teams improve their communication and problem-solving capabilities. Initially, the facilitator adopts the **Process
Consultant** role, asking questions to clarify the teams' frustrations and goals. As the sessions progress, the facilitator moves into the
**Doctor** role to suggest specific frameworks and strategies for improvement. In the final stages, the facilitator shifts to the **Rubber Duck**  
attitude, allowing the teams to discuss and process their own solutions while offering minimal input.
The flexibility in shifting between roles leads to a more effective collaboration across departments.

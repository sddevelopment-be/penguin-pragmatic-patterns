abstract = """
The goal of software documentation is to be useful: providing clarity and support to developers maintaining and expanding the codebase.
Yet, the time spent on external tools to write and update documentation often feels like a distraction from actual coding.
In this lightning talk, we’ll explore a more streamlined approach: using tools and techniques that allow developers to stay in the codebase
while generating useful documentation artifacts.

From naming conventions, comments, and tests to diagrams-as-code and static site generators, we’ll dive into practical strategies to reduce friction
and make documentation as low-effort as possible. The aim isn’t to eliminate documentation tasks, but to integrate them smoothly into the
development workflow. Providing actionable tips, this session is aimed at developers looking to maintain useful documentation without breaking their
flow.

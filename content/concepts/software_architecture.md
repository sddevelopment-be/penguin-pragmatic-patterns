The nuance between "architecture" and "design" is difficult to grasp.
One is an extension of the other, but defining clear boundaries between both is tricky.

## Description

In simple words, software architecture is the process of converting system characteristics such as flexibility, scalability, feasibility,
re-usability, and security into a structured solution that meets the technical and the business expectations.

This definition prompts us to consider the characteristics that can impact the design of software architecture - a comprehensive list encompassing
business, operational, and technical requirements.

### System Characteristics

System characteristics, often referred to as 'Quality Attributes' or 'Non-functional requirements,' define the operational and technical
prerequisites and expectations of a software system. For instance, when a product owner emphasizes competing in rapidly changing markets and the
need for swift adaptation of the business model, key characteristics like 'extendability,' 'modularity,' and 'maintainability' become crucial.

Similarly, if a system should handle urgent requests requiring successful completion within tight timeframes, the software architect
must prioritize 'performance,' 'low fault tolerance,' 'scalability,' and 'reliability.'

Now, imagine the business owner also mentions a limited budget for the projectâ€”this introduces another critical characteristic: 'feasibility.'

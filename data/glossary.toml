these groups must work together to achieve their shared goal. Therefore, the software produced by these teams will invariably
resemble the structure of the teams themselves.
As an example, a company with two separate teams working for different departments (invoicing and sales) will likely produce software that
is divided into two separate modules, one for invoicing and one for sales. These modules will probably interact with each other along pre-defined interfaces.
Much like the teams interact with each other along pre-defined communication channels. If the teams are working in isolation, the software will likely be built in a similar way,

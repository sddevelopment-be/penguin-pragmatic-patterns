## Goal, Philosophy and outline

A lot of knowledge is available on the internet, in various talks, and in books.
But finding your way in this vast ocean of knowledge can be a challenge.
In order to assist fellow learners, we have started to collect our personal experiences in this repository.

The initiative was started by [@stijn-dejongh](https://github.com/stijn-Dejongh), who is a self-improvement enthousiast, and an avid software developer.
In order to avoid confusing terminology and avoid having to explain the definition of certain words multiple times, please take a look at the [Glossary](<./docs/0 Glossary>).

## Repository Structure

Most of the techniques, tactics, and behavioural patterns collected will fit some sort of category, which is usually outlined by the title of the directory in which the content is stored.
Some general purpose information will be stored at the top level.

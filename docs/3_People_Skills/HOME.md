# 3_People_Skills

When reading stories or career advice for people in the technical sector on social media,
much content is dedicated to technical excellence and workflow processes.

You might be familiar with phrases such as _"You won't really be a developer unless you learn such and such framework"_,
_"All good developers have read this and that book"_, _"You really need to know these and those concepts"_.  
While most of this is true (to a certain extent), most people that work in the tech industry
tend to consistently undervalue the importance of being able to express yourself.
There is a lot of value in generally getting along with the people you interact with on a daily basis.

> Having great ideas gets you nowhere fast, if you are unable to communicate your knowledge to others.

The stereotype of the computer geek sitting in a basement and only interacting with people through
some sort of ticketing system can be quite accurate to some extent.
Personally, I feel best when I have the sense of moving forward and collaborating on tackling a
challenge together with my peers.

## Pomodoro focus

### Problem statement

You are distracted by various input in your environment, causing you to not finish the task yous et out to do.

### Drivers

#### Enablers

* You wish to complete tasks to be best of your ability, and as fast as circumstances allow. 
* The tasks you perform require your attention, and take sufficiently long to accomplish.
* You can split your tasks into smaller parts, each of which add some value on their own accord.

#### Deterrents

* It is demotivating to drudge through a backlog of work.
* Your main activity requires you to switch between various tasks quickly.
* The tasks you are performing often take a few moments of your time and do not require focus.
* Your environment rewards __looking__ busy over __being__ busy.

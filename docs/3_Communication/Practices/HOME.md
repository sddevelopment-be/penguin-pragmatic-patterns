## Hosting engaging retrospectives

### Context

> A retrospective, generally, is a look back at events that took place, or works that were produced, in the past.

Hosting a useful retrospective session is quite difficult. You aim to have a group share their frustrations, obstacles, and
share knowledge about what went well. One of the risks of having a static retro format, are that teams lose interest in the sessions, and
are less engaged during the meeting.
We aim to avoid this staleness by varying the "theme" of the retro, while keeping the general structure the same.

Every group can employ slight variations on the approach used, based on a similar template.
The aim of these alternating retro formats is to stimulate constructive communication between team members.While the team lead or management
are present during the discussions, and have the final decision on actions proposed, they should refrain from taking an authoritative
position during the retro.

### Drivers

- You are helping a team or project being in a rut, going through the motions without engaging or following-up on issues and frustrations.
- We can only start improving the situation once we know what is going on
- People perform better when they feel involved in their work
- Most people are intimidated by authority
- People do not like to feel ridiculous and want to be taken seriously

#### Enablers

- Team/Management is willing to try, and dedicate time to improve their process
- Trust in the intentions and skills of the facilitator or person taking the initiative
- Team members feel safe to share their opinions without fear of reprisals

#### Deterrents

- The group has no motivation to experiment with alternative ways of working
- You are operating in a low trust, high conflict environment
- You can not invest the time to be a driving force of change

### Solution

* Gather the team, and openly discuss what it was like to work together over the past X weeks.
* Pocus on making sure every voice is heard, and the discussion is not dominated by a couple of strong-willed individuals

> "A plan or framework is very useful, as you need something to adapt and deviate from as you gain experience."
> ~ Paraphrased quote by [Rini van Solingen](https://rinivansolingen.nl/)

The sections below are intended as a starting point for hosting your own retrospective sessions. You are obviously welcome, and even
encouraged, to adapt them to fit your group's specific needs. We do recommend giving the described structure a try first, to get a feel for
the practice before changing it.

#### Retro participant roles

<!-- tabs:start -->

##### **Facilitator**

Guards the integrity of the retro. He/she is the timekeeper, and the lord-and-master of the retro. During the retro, this person is allowed
to overrule any participant or tell them to shut up (Even if they are their superior in the group hierarchy).

> From personal experience, the person executing this role is more effective when not participating in discussions or votes. The downside of
> sitting out the session is made up for by rotating this role.

##### **Participant**

Joins the retro, raises issues (tickets/stickies, etc), votes on discussion points, engages in constructive dialogue.

##### **Observer**

> "You can sit in the room/meeting/call, but you are not to speak"

Is invited to listen to the retro, but does not participate.
If an observer does not stick to their accepted role, the facilitator should give them the choice between switching to a participator role,
or leaving the meeting.

##### **Scribe**

**can be combined with any other role**

Responsible for taking notes on discussions and actions taken.Personal experience teaches that this is best combined with the roles "
Facilitator" or "Observer".

<!-- tabs:end -->

#### Retro structure

When using a specific retro theme, feel free to tell a small story (1-2 minute fluff). Bonus points for everyone that looks amused.Verify
everyone understands the goals and outline of the retro.

<details>
<summary>1. Set the stage</summary>
<p>

Welcome the participants, reiterate the goal of the retro:

- constructive dialogue
- evaluation of previous actions (if not first retro)
- definition of safe-to-fail experiments (actionable items)
- consensus based assignment of accountability for actions to be taken

When using a specific theme, feel free to tell a small story (1-2 minute fluff). Bonus points for everyone that looks amused.Verify everyone
understands the goals and outline of the retro.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
2. Warm up (~5min preparation)
</summary>
<p>

Goal: get people talking, break the ice.

You can do this by going around the table and check on with everyone.
If _"how are you feeling right now?"_ is not a comfortable question, change it up a bit.
There is a wide selection of icebreaker exercises that can make this process more comfortable and enjoyable.

We have had good results with:

- _"What is your favorite movie, and why?"_
- _"Tell us two things about yourself that we did not know"_
- _"Who is your favorite pirate?"_
- _"What was your favorite childhood game?"_

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
3. Personal preparation of discussion topics
</summary>
<p>
Reflection on the work performed in the time since the past retro (or the past X days, if this is the first retrospective in a while). Participants are to write down their thoughts without speaking to each other.
In general, the group aims to answer (some of) the following questions:
- What went well?
- What did not go well?
- What should we start/keep doing?
- What should we stop doing?

Reflection, and writing down feedback is usually guided by the theme of the retro.
You can mix up the format a bit, and change the questions or "sticky-note categories" from time to time.
This generally helps keep things fresh. You might also notice that responses vary quite a bit, when using a differently phrased prompt.

**Important to note:** when raising a personal experienced issue, participates are not expected to also have a solution ready.

> There are a lot of resources out there to help you. Take a look at the _"references"_ section below to dig for cool ideas.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
4. Round-table presentation of possible topics
</summary>
<p>
- All participants present their topic/thoughts/feedback and add their sticky notes to the shared retro board
- These topics should only need 2-3 sentences to outline their intent
- Be as time-efficient as possible here! The value is in the discussion in the group, not so much in presenting the possible topics.

> When using a digital retro board, participants are to prepare their points on their own machine (notepad, zim, word document, ...) so the
> text can be copy-pasted during the presentation of topics, instead of typed out

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
5. Reducing ticket count / Grouping
</summary>
<p>
Link related tickets, in a consensus-based way.
The group may decide to give the facilitator the trust to handle this without much discussion for efficiency reasons.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
6. Voting
</summary>
<p>
- Participants receive a number of votes (based on amount of tickets, and participants)
- Each person may spend multiple votes on a single ticket (e.g. they only care deeply about one topic)
- When voting, it is advised to not spend votes to indicate agreement with a topic/opinion. Only vote on the items you wish to discuss as a team.
- Special rules can be added to the voting process ( e.g. "Everyone must spend at least one vote on a ticket in category X")

After voting is completed, the tickets are ordered by amounts of votes in descending order.
This means the most voted-upon topics are at the top of the discussion list.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
7. Discussion and consensus-based action definition
</summary>
<p>
- Start with the highest voted topic (In case of a tie, the facilitator picks a starting topic)
- The person who added the ticket shortly introduces the discussion topic
- Everyone is invited and expected to actively participate during the discussions
- The facilitator can elect to ask somebody's opinion if they notice a certain participant has been quiet for a while (or they know this person has something of value to add to the dialogue)
- The goal of the discussion is to define an actionable item or safe-to-fail experiment, or to agree that no action is needed.

> **PRO-TIP:** Timebox discussions, using a pomodoro technique
> To ensure a good pace, you can use the _"pomodoro technique"_ to timebox discussions.
> The facilitator sets a timer for the first round of discussion. When the timer expires, the group votes to continue the discussion or move
> to the next point. If the discussion is continued, a new timer is set (using a smaller timebox).
> Repeat until the group decides that the raised topic has been resolved.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
8. Wrap up
</summary>
<p>

Reiterate over the key points of the different discussions and the actions that were proposed.
As a group, ask for volunteers to take ownership over the actionable items.Note that this does not necessarily mean they have to do all the
required work, they are just accountable to ensure that the team follows up on the action.

> Once the actionable items are all assigned, it is advisory to go over the action list again.
>
> Because, repetition works.  
> Also, repeating stuff helps people remember it.  
> And on top of that, repetition works.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
9. Checkout
</summary>
<p>
Go around the group and ask how each participant experienced the retrospective. Do they feel more energetic/motivated?
Do they have anything that is still on their chest? 
Thank everyone for attending and participating.

Closing statements by facilitator/team lead can happen here.
Leave some room for general messages or updates.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
10. Follow-up
</summary>
<p>
The facilitator (or person assigned to take notes) creates a write-up of the retrospective discussion and the actions to be taken. This write-up is shared with the team.

> Since the write-up consists of the actions agreed upon by consensus, every team members is encouraged to read through the write-up and
> validate it is consistent with the discussion that took place.  
> A good way to do this is to add a small "Acknowledge" section to the document and ask everyone to sign the write-up. Basically similar to
> the "Read and approved" section in some legal documents.

</p>
</details>

### Measuring success

- The group is engaged during the sessions
- Multiple voices are heard
- You are able to stay within the assigned timebox most times
- The actions decided upon during the retro are executed

## Walking the talk


### Context
![Image of pony looking devious, but claiming to be sad about your misfortune. >](./congruence.webp ':size=186')

Quick! Think of that one person who said something, and then showed they did not mean it by how they were behaving.  
Did you think of someone? Maybe it was hard to choose only one person, as people tend to do this often.

How did you feel about that person afterwards? Do you trust them?
Do you feel they were being honest?   
Or perhaps you think they acted in the most hypocritical way imaginable [^0].

### Drivers

* People tend to remember past interactions and assume future interactions will be similar
* Non-verbal communication, such as body language and actions, tell us more than words ever could
* You come over as trustworthy if you have a history of acting in an honest, and professional manner. Conversely, you
  will be perceived as unreliable if you fail to do so.
* _“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit.”_ ~ Will Durant[^1].
  Neuroscience has proven that our brains _'rewire'_ themselves by repeating actions over and over.
  This is what makes habits, trauma, and false beliefs so hard to break.
* We live and operate in a collaborative society. It is in our own best interest if others are willing to help us out,
  and trust us.
* Forcing yourself to act against your beliefs is one of the known causes of occupational burnout. Research refers to this as _"
  conflicting values"_ or _"loss of agency and control"_ [^2].

#### Enablers

* You have the means to keep track of time, and to take note of the promises you make.
* Your environment is comfortable holding people (including yourself) accountable for their promises, and preferably does so in a non-aggressive way
* You value honesty and reliability in others, and know the frustration of counting on someone who does not pull through
* You have access to low latency communication devices.

#### Deterrents

* Taking any form of responsibility is discouraged by your environment for whatever reason.
* You are expected to say "yes" to everything, regardless of whether you mean it or not.
* You do not care about being perceived as reliable

### Solution

Achieving this is actually quite simple. Simple, but not easy.
The core behaviours to be congruent in words and actions are:  
* "Say what you mean, and mean what you say"
* Respond in a clear way, and follow through. Do not make promises you can not keep, or do not intend to keep.
  * Say "yes" when you mean "yes"
  * Say "no" when you mean "no"
  * Be forthcoming when you do not possess the information or agency required to give any of these answers, and refer to someone who does. Alternatively, you can tell the person making a request of you to check in a later time and make sure you have the required information by then.
* Do not back out of difficult interactions
* Admit when you made a mistake or break a promise, even when in public

As I said, the idea is very simple. But it can be very challenging to apply.
It usually goes wrong when the other party does not accept your answer. Be very careful of placating or "weaseling out" of giving a definitive and clear answer.
Weasel words include:
- "Maybe"
- "I will try"
- "If I find the time"
- "We'll see" followed by a vague promise to revisit the topic at an undefined point in time or in some alternate universe
- "I was late, because of XXXXX"
  

It is very easy to weasel out of making a commitment, as it takes courage to take accountability for the possibility of failure.
And there will be ample times where you make a commitment and break your promise. This can happen for whatever reason, and some of those reasons might even be valid.
Though here is the kicker: **your reasons for not pulling through are irrelevant to the people counting on you**.

To ameliorate the frustration people feel when you can not live up to your promises, **give them advance warning of your inability to follow through**.
This is not a silver bullet "fix all issues" approach, as you still wrote a check they can not cash. But at the very least, you give others the opportunity to change their plans if needed.
Do this too often, and your reputation will suffer. Do not do this often enough, and you will be perceived as a liar.


### Examples

#### The cake is a lie

![a conversation between Alex and his mom, filled to the brim with half-promisses and unclear communication <](./dialogue_broken_promises.png ':size=680')

This fictional dialogue between Alex and his mom illustrate a complete breakdown in communication. What went wrong here?
Who is to blame? The answer is somewhat convoluted, as all parties involved were not being clear. Alex made an initial commitment to his colleagues that he would provide homemade cake.
When making this promise, he knew he would have to ask someone for help, as he can not bake a cake to save his life. He assumed he could persuade his mother to bake the cake for him, as she used to do when he was a child.
At this point, Alex is acting in bad faith. He should have checked Brunhilda's availability and willingness to help him out before making a promise to his co-workers.  

During the phone call, Alex tried to manipulate his mother into making the cake even though Brunhilda clearly told him that she does not have the time to do so. 
Because her son was using his "nagging child" routine, and she wanted to get out of the conversation without any conflict, Brunhilda gave a non-committal response.
In doing so, Brunhilda acted against her own values of never making promises you can not keep. In her mind, she never made an explicit promise to help.
But that is not what Alex wanted to hear, so he decided to interpret it as an agreement to make the cake.  

Neither party decided to follow-up on the conversation. Brunhilda could have let Alex know that she would not be able to make the cake, as she unexpectedly had do deal with a problem at work.
Alex could have called his mother a few days before the party to check if she would be able to bake the cake. Alex could have also told his colleagues that they would likely have to make due with store-bought cake, and buy one as a fall-back plan.
From Alex' point of view, his mom was unreliable. From Alex' colleagues point of view, he failed to deliver on his promise, and they were forced to spend the evening cake-less.

Similarly to concepts, sharing practices with people helps to create a shared understanding. It can be helpful to groups to refer to practices by their name, enabling more efficient communication.
However, without a clear description of their meaning, the use of jargon can cause confusion and misunderstandings.
<br />
<br />
To help you find practices that helps you in your particular challenges, each practice contains a description of the **context** in which you can
use it. This context is described as `enablers` and `deterrents`, these indicate under which conditions the described pattern is know to work 
well, and conversely when it doesn't work well. To get the best results, pay attention to these factors when reading the patterns below.

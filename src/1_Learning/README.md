## Why learn about learning?

Over the ages, a lot of research has been done on just how people are able to learn and acquire new skills. As humans, we often feel a need to know how good we are at something, and how to become better. In the following sections, we will go over a few of the more useful conceptual models on the stages of mastery.
In the modern knowledge-based economy, being apt at learning new skills and concepts is a significant competitive advantage.

## Meta-Learning

Meta learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as "the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized". Maudsley sets the conceptual basis of his theory as synthesized under headings of assumptions, structures, change process, and facilitation. Five principles were enunciated to facilitate meta learning. Learners must:

- have a theory,however primitive
- work in a safe supportive social and physical environment
- discover their rules and assumptions
- reconnect with reality-information from the environment
- reorganize themselves by changing their rules/assumptions.

There is a lot to know about software development. The field is vast, and the body of knowledge is growing at an incredible pace[^2].
The image below show a few of the topics that are relevant to a software developer. It is by no means exhaustive, but it gives a good idea of
the sheer quantity of knowledge that is required to be proficient.

In an attempt to simplify your path to mastery, I have divided the knowledge required to be a proficient software developer into four main pillars.
These pillars represent the core categories of skills that are required to be successful in the field.
We will discuss them each in a dedicated chapter, where we will dive deeper into the subject.
For now, let's have a look at the four pillars, and why they are relevant to your progression.

### Learning

The only thing that is constant is change. In order to be effective, we must constantly adapt to new situations.

As our field is constantly evolving, and developers tend to switch contexts regularly, one of the most important skills to master is how to learn.
Contrary to popular belief, learning is a skill that can be honed. It is not something that you are born with, or without.
What is more, learning is not a one-size-fits-all activity. Different people learn in different ways, and at different paces.

### Communication

Having a good idea is not enough.
One must be able to influence others to make it happen.

We talked about software development being a human-focussed field. As such, it is important to be able to communicate effectively.
Communication happens when information is exchanged. Note the importance of the word "exchange" here. It is not enough to be able to speak
eloquently, or to write well. Your communication depends on your ability to get the message across.   
How many times have you listened to a speaker, only to realize that you have no idea what they were talking about?
If you want to increase your impact at work, and open more opportunities for yourself, communicating your ideas effectively is a must.

### Productivity

Knowing how to do something is a start.
Now, you need to actually make it happen.

### Programming

is deprecated, seven others appear out of thin air to take its place. It's like a hydra, but with less heads and more tentacles.

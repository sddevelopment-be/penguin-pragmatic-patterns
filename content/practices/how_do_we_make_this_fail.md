## Problem Statement

You have an idea and want to strengthen it against negative forces. 

## Intent

* Discover critical risks to your ideas.
* Reflect on ways to cope with setbacks.
* Harden your idea by limiting failure conditions.

## Contextual forces

### Enablers

### Deterrents

## Solution

Try and sabotage your own ideas and plans. Think about your suggested approach, and ask yourself: __"How can I make sure this fails?"__.
Be as creative as you can, not limiting yourself to common expected issues.
For this technique to be effective, you need to actively try to undermine yourself.  

Once you have a list of all the ways you can ensure failure, sort them from "most impactful" to "least impactful".
Be sure you have thought about ways of dealing with the 5 most likely scenarios. Next, think about how to mitigate the 3 least likely failure 
scenario's.

If you are open to investing a bit more effort, include the likelihood of these "sabotages" to happen (high probability to low probability). 
This way, you end up with a 2-by-2 matrix. Try and focus your attention to the failure modes that have the highest impact.

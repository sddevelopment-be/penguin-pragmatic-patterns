## Organize your workflow

### Context


### Drivers

* You want to finalize your tasks and "get things done"
* People are often distracted by their own thoughts
* Multitasking is hard. Our brains work better if we can compartmentalize between different modes of thinking
* Our memories are very lossy. We tend to forget about things all the time
* Standard To-Do lists have no readily available means of prioritizing items
* Having too many things on our mind stresses us out

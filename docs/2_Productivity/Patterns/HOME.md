# Patterns


## Productivity Patterns 
This section is a collection of Productivity related patterns.
The patterns are meant as a guideline for your day-to-day development activities and will
 hopefully offer you a mental framework to reason about the tasks you are asked to perform.

For consistency, the patterns follow a similar structure.
As we all know, **context matters**. This is why each pattern is prefaced with a short description of 
when it can be useful to consider using it. The aim is not to apply as many of them as you can on any given task.
**This is not a bingo chart.**

The pattern section is followed by a series of **articles** that were written in the past by myself, 
or others. If I do not hold the copyright of the material included here, it will be mentioned and the 
original author will be asked for approval before the content is included here.

## Practices 

Practices are a set of actionable recipes, that can help you achieve certain goals.
As with all advise, these are not guaranteed to give results. These is no such thing as a 
sure-fire approach that works in any situation.

In order to make these patterns as helpful as possible, they include a short description of the 
circumstances in which they usually work well.

Unlike pokemon, you will not get a special prize for implementing all of them in your life.
You are encouraged to be eclectic, and only use the practices that resonate with you.

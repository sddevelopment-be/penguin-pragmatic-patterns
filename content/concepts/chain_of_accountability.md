## Definition

> Offer a precise definition of the concept.
> Include this in the [../GLOSSARY.md](glossary) as well.

## Key Components

Implementation of any idea can be broken down into key phases and components, each of which playing a bounded role, resulting in a coherent 
hierarchy of accountability.

* **Goal:** Defining the target, or overall objective. It should be the guiding light that informs all other components, directing the 
  decision-making process towards the desired outcome.
* **Strategy:** The high-level plan that outlines the approach to achieve the goal. It should be broad enough to allow for flexibility, 
  but detailed enough to provide a clear direction.
* **Tactics:** A more specific, practical, description of the actions to be taken to execute the strategy. They should be concrete and actionable, 
  providing a roadmap for the 'execution' component.
* **Execution:** Actual implementation of the tactics, in accordance with the strategy, to achieve the goal. It is where the rubber meets the road, 
  and the plan first comes into contact with reality. Most of the time, adjustments will be necessary to account for unforeseen circumstances.
* **Result:** The outcome of the execution, which should be measured against the goal to determine the success of the strategy. This is the 
  culmination of all the previous components. Inspecting, and understanding, the result helps us see where the plan succeeded, and where it fell 
  short.
* **Rollout:** After the result has been evaluated, it needs to be delivered to the stakeholders. In this phase, the focus is on stabilization, 
  and ensuring that the benefits of the result are realized. The rollout phase is where the work is fully exposed to the world. 
* **Follow-up:** After the rollout, it is important to follow up on the outcome, and ensure that the benefits are sustained. This phase is about 
  maintaining the momentum, and ensuring that the plan continues to deliver value. It is also the time to gather feedback, track the impact of 
  the results, and spend time reflecting on the process.

### Examples

#### The sixth of June, 1944

* **Goal:** Liberate Western Europe from the grip of the facist regime.
* **Strategy:** Launch a massive amphibious assault on the beaches of Normandy, sending every able body we can muster. Land on the beaches, and 
  establish a foothold. Then push inland, making sure supply lines are secured. 
* **Tactics:** Use SOE paracommando's to secure key bridges and roads, to prevent the enemy from reinforcing their positions. Use amphibious 
  personnel carriers to land infantry on the beaches, make sure the infantry knows to disembark as soon as they hit the beach. Let the royal 
  navy barrage the bulkheads on the beaches with artillery during the landing, to soften up the enemy positions. Use the element of surprise to gain a foothold before the enemy can react.
* **Execution:** Bob Jenkins, a private in the 3rd infantry division, is on a barge preparing to land on Omaha beach. He is part of the first 
  wave, and is tasked with securing a beachhead. When the barge nears the beach, and the armored hatch opens, the enemy opens fire. His squad is 
  decimated before they can disembark. Private Jenkins is lucky enough to be standing near the back of the barge, and is able to jump over the 
  side; as he was instructed to do. He is shot in the leg, but manages to crawl to a nearby tank, and uses it as cover to return fire. 
* **Result:** The allies manage to secure a beachhead, but at a heavy cost. The first wave of the assault is decimated, and the follow-up waves 
  are delayed. The allies manage to secure the beaches, but the advance inland is slow. The airborne divisions manage to secure key bridges, 
  but the paratroopers are scattered, and it takes time to regroup.
* **Rollout:** The allies manage to secure the beaches, and the follow-up waves manage to land. The allies manage to push inland, and secure 
  the supply lines. The allies manage to secure a foothold, and the liberation of Western Europe is underway. As the allies push inland, 
  reservist troops and local militias are used to keep the reclaimed territory secure.
* **Follow-up:** The allies manage to liberate Western Europe, and the war is won. The allies manage to secure the peace, and the Marshall plan 
  is put into effect to rebuild the war-torn continent. The allies manage to secure the peace, and the United Nations is founded to prevent 
  future conflicts.

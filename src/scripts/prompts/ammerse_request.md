AMMERSE is a decision making framework that helps you evaluate decisions systematically. It stands for:

* Agile (A) – Encouraging adaptability and quick response to change.   
  (eg. Feedback loops, Continuous Improvement, Adaptable, Responsive, Decisions)
* Minimal (Mi) – Advocating for simplicity and efficiency in all operations.    
  (eg. Costs, Problem, Solution, Risk, Design, Process, People, Objective, Impact)
* Maintainable (M) – Prioritizing solutions that are easy to sustain and improve.   
  (eg. Repairable, Repeatable, Cost, Quality, Performance, Growth)
* Environmental (E) – Promoting awareness and consideration of environmental impact.  
  (eg. Sustainable, Inclusive Culture, Regulations, Stability, Safe, Secure, Ethical)
* Reachable (R) – Setting achievable goals within time and budget constraints.   
  (eg. Skills, Time, Budget, Market, Geography, Sales, Growth, Objective, Capacity, Customers)
* Solvable (S) – Focusing on effective problem-solving strategies.  
  (eg. Problems now and in the future, Innovative, Creates Problems, Meta Problems, Decisions, known good practices)
* Extensible (Ex) – Designing for the future with adaptable and scalable solutions.  
  (eg. Plug-in, Snap-On, Reusable, Context-Insensitive)

When introducing new techniques or decisions to an environment, there will be an impact on the context which is reflected in a change of the AMMERSE values.
It is important to be critical of techniques and outline both the positive and negative deltas, as sometimes a decrease in a certain value is desired.

Please rate the impact of the `` pattern following the AMMERSE values.
Use  a simple scale ranging from -2 to +2, where -2 is a significant negative impact, 0 is neutral, and +2 is a significant positive impact. 
Provide your reasoning for each of the ratings.

## Baptizing your code

In a surprising amount of fairy tales, myths, and legends the _"power of naming"_ is an ancient magical ability that allows you to control things if you just know how it is
really called. Programming is not much different. If the entities and variables you work with have revealing names, a confusing piece of code becomes very clear.
This clarity is achieved by simple renaming things to be expressive, a feat most modern IDE's can do for you at little cost.  

### Applicable Context

You are writing or reading code written by yourself or colleagues, and notice that some of the 
function names or parameters have names that do not add much meaning to the code itself. If the code is significantly harder to read than your average fantasy novel, chances are the names of the `functions`, `parameters`, and `variables` are in need of some attention and nursing.   

Some of the thoughts that are likely to cross your mind while reading the code are:  
- [ ] _"I think I kind of know what this code block is supposed to do"_  
- [ ] _"So this variable contains the result of the calculation, right?"_  
- [ ] _"We start in method X which does a thing, and then call this other thingy that does ...."_

## Estimation techniques

### Context

In a professional environment, and especially those that generate revenue by providing deliverables at regular intervals, a well defined schedule is of vital importance. For most of us, the world of management is somewhat of a mystery. So let us pull back the veil on this world just a little bit (not too much to avoid letting the demons that live there escape). Usually, when discussing budgets or assigning people to priority work, managers use techniques to assess whether or not a certain goal can be reached before a given deadline.

From time to time, a delivery date is fixed and the challenge is in distributing the work required to achieve it. This is to be done while taking internal dependencies between these tasks into account.
Most often though, the deadline is not set in stone. The customer will decide whether or not to purchase the promised delivery, based on the time it will take to get it done. In the world of software design, customers tend to ask for ballpark estimates. These types of high level estimates (usually expressed in weeks, or months) allow a customer to check if they have the budget to spend on a certain piece of software. If the expected cost turns out to be too high, the work can be postponed to the next fiscal year.

#### Email conversation with D. Gallina

While working as a team lead for a large client, I had the pleasure of attending an estimation workshop by [mr. Davide Gallina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidegallina/). We had a follow-up conversation on how to familiarize young professionals with the task of estimating their work.
All too often less-experienced colleagues are either extremely optimistic when asked for an estimated completion date (_"It should be done tomorrow"_). Other times they panic and try to avoid saying anything at all, for fear of their estimation becoming a promise.

> In my current context, the team consists mostly of young graduates/junior level developers. While they are technically quite strong, they tend to significantly underestimate the time it takes to complete a task.  
> 
> As you said during your presentation: explaining to them that the full development cycle goes further than just hacking together something that works helps a bit in this regard. The flip side of them understanding there is more to development is that they are not confident in their abilities to properly estimate the amount of effort a task requires.  
> So even when you do team-based estimations (planning poker, etc), the more junior people in the team tend to follow whomever they trust more.  
> A minimal example is: _'During planning poker, the juniors estimates range from 1 hour to 15 days. Afterwards a discussion is started. One of the more experience team members explain their point of view, and one says it will be at least 6 days of work. We start round two of the planning poker sessions, and all juniors say the task will take 7 days.'.

> Often, these less-experienced developers do not know what their estimates are used for (budgeting, client billing, tender, etc.). When you try to explain to them what value their estimate holds, they tend to get a bit scared. Some of them will refuse to give their opinion, other will eventually say a number.
> Afterwards, when they are developing the code and now understand how important estimates can be, they see them more as a strict deadline than as a guiding figure.  
>  
> I was wondering if you have experience with this issue, and if there are practical tips and tricks I could use to find a middle ground between 'not caring' and 'stressed rushing'.
> I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this challenge, and I apologize for not being able to phrase the question in a less verbose way.

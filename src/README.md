## Outline

A learning and development repository, aimed to share knowledge with other technical professionals.
The docs section of this repository is somewhat of a "personal wiki". 
It contains knowledge and information that has been collected from various sources, and is extended with some personal interpretations and experiences of the author.

## Purpose

As we live our lives, we tend to learn a great deal about a wide variety of topics.
From time to time we are stumped by how elegant, or easy, someone solves a certain problem. And you are left wondering why you have not been tackling similar problems in the same way. It could have saved you vast amounts of frustrations, if only you had known earlier.

The aim of this catalogue is to bundle some of the little nuggets of enlightment these "aha"-moments tend to deliver.
Our hope is that someone, somewhere learns something that makes their lives a litle bit more enjoyable.

## Intended Audience

## Structure

This open knowledge collection is ordered by categories. Each of these categories contains 
some of the following resources: 

- **A collection of Patterns:**  
- **Articles and short form information:** These sections contain a list of articles that were written by either myself or others and added with their permission. These articles can be opinionated pieces, additional context, or specific case-studies.
- **Resources and Reviews :** 

A set of concepts and common abbreviations can be found in the [glossary](./X_APPENDIX/glossary).

### Patterns

For consistency, the patterns follow a similar structure.
As we all know, **context matters**. This is why each pattern is prefaced with a short description of 
when it can be useful to consider using it. The aim is not to apply as many of them as you can on any given task.
**This is not a bingo chart.**

## Definition

> Offer a precise definition of the concept.
> Include this in the [../GLOSSARY.md](glossary) as well.

## Key Components

Implementation of any idea can be broken down into key phases and components, each of which playing a bounded role, resulting in a coherent 
hierarchy of accountability.

* **Goal:** Defining the target, or overall objective. It should be the guiding light that informs all other components, directing the 
  decision-making process towards the desired outcome.
* **Strategy:** The high-level plan that outlines the approach to achieve the goal. It should be broad enough to allow for flexibility, 
  but detailed enough to provide a clear direction.
* **Tactics:** A more specific, practical, description of the actions to be taken to execute the strategy. They should be concrete and actionable, 
  providing a roadmap for the 'execution' component.
* **Execution:** Actual implementation of the tactics, in accordance with the strategy, to achieve the goal. It is where the rubber meets the road, 
  and the plan first comes into contact with reality. Most of the time, adjustments will be necessary to account for unforeseen circumstances.
* **Result:** The outcome of the execution, which should be measured against the goal to determine the success of the strategy. This is the 
  culmination of all the previous components. Inspecting, and understanding, the result helps us see where the plan succeeded, and where it fell 
  short.
* **Rollout:** After the result has been evaluated, it needs to be delivered to the stakeholders. In this phase, the focus is on stabilization, 
  and ensuring that the benefits of the result are realized. The rollout phase is where the work is fully exposed to the world. 
* **Follow-up:** After the rollout, it is important to follow up on the outcome, and ensure that the benefits are sustained. This phase is about 
  maintaining the momentum, and ensuring that the plan continues to deliver value. It is also the time to gather feedback, track the impact of 
  the results, and spend time reflecting on the process.

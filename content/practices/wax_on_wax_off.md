## Problem statement

You are learning a new skill, and have understood the basic principles or idea. Applying your budding knowledge consistently is proving to be a
challenge.

## Intent

* Find a repeatable exercise, that fits your schedule, and perform it as often as possible.
* Gain a deeper understanding of the skill you are attempting to master.
* Make corresponding techniques second nature, so you do not have to think about how you are doing something while you are doing it.

## Contextual forces

### Enablers

* You are determined to master this new skill.
* You enjoy the feeling of being in a flow state.
* There are exercises available, which you can replicate.
* You are able, and willing, to allocate time for dedicated practice.
* You are being supported by a mentor, or have other means to solicit feedback on your technique.

### Deterrents

* You give up easily.
* You are not able, or not willing, to dedicate time for practise.
* You do not know where to start, and have no means of learning from a skilled practitioner.
* You have a tendency to jump to a new and shiny thing before understanding yor current objective.

## Solution

![Scene from the Karate Kid movie.](/images/practices/miyagi_wax_on.gif)

* Identify an easily repeatable exercise[^1]
    * Ideally, the exercise takes a maximum of 30 minutes to complete
    * For most skills, you can find a compendium of recommended exercises online or in books.
* Perform the chosen exercise multiple times
    * at first focussing intently on how you are doing in detail, going as slow as needed to not make any mistakes
    * repeat the exercise at least weekly, but aim for a higher frequency at first
    * once you are able to perform the required actions without needing to actively think about them, start slowly increasing your speed
* Revisit your practice regularly, even if you have moved on to more advanced skills and their corresponding exercises. It pays dividends to
  retrain your fundamentals.

[^1]: In martial arts, this is called a "kata". A kata is generally a select few movements, which are executed in a fixed order at a fixed
cadence. Even though these are solitary drills, practitioners are told to imagine they are fighting against real opponents while performing
their routines.

## Description

We value to ability to stay rational, calm, and collected in any situation.

Think of your run-of-the-mill action hero. In general, you will find they are extremely stoic. Nothing phases them. Their adversaries generally
become frustrated with their inability to trigger a response from the hero, causing them to do loose their cool, make bad decisions to annoy the 
hero. Their inability to stay calm leading directly to their downfall.

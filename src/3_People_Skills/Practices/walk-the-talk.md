## Walk the talk: act congruently

### Context

Quick! Think of that one person who said something, and then showed they did not mean it by how they were behaving.  
Did you think of someone? Maybe it was hard to choose only one person, as people tend to do this often.

How did you feel about that person afterwards? Do you trust them?
Do you feel they were being honest?   
Or perhaps you think they acted in the most hypocritical way imaginable [^0].

### Drivers

* People tend to remember past interactions and assume future interactions will be similar
* Non-verbal communication, such as body language and actions, tell us more than words ever could
* You come over as trustworthy if you have a history of acting in an honest, and professional manner. Conversely, you
  will be perceived as unreliable if you fail to do so.
* _“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit.”_ ~ Will Durant[^1].
  Neuroscience has proven that our brains _'rewire'_ themselves by repeating actions over and over.
  This is what makes habits, trauma, and false beliefs so hard to break.
* We live and operate in a collaborative society. It is in our own best interest if others are willing to help us out,
  and trust us.
* Occupational burnout can be caused by forcing yourself to act against your beliefs. Research refers to this as _"
  conflicting values"_ or _"loss of agency and control"_ [^2].

#### Enablers

* You have the means to keep track of time, and to take note of the promises you make.
* Your environment is confortable with holding people (including yourself) accountable for their promises, and preferably does so in a non-aggressive way
* You value honesty and reliability in others, and know the frustration of counting on someone who does not pull through
* You have access to low latency communication devices.

#### Deterrents

* Taking any form of responsibility is discouraged by your environment for whatever reason.
* You are expected to say "yes" to everything, regardless of whether you mean it or not.
* You do not care about being perceived as reliable

### Solution

Achieving this is actually quite simple. Simple, but not easy.
The core behaviours to be congruent in words and actions are:  
* "Say what you mean, and mean what you say"
* Respond in a clear way, and follow through. Do not make promises you can not keep, or do not intend to keep.
  * Say "yes" when you mean "yes"
  * Say "no" when you mean "no"
  * Be forthcoming when you do not possess the information or agency required to give any of these answers, and refer to someone who does. Alternatively, you can tell the person making a request of you to check in a later time and make sure you have the required information by then.
* Do not back out of difficult interactions
* Admit when you made a mistake or break a promise, even when in public

As I said, the idea is very simple. But it can be very challenging to apply.
It usually goes wrong when the other party does not accept your answer. Be very careful of placating or "weaseling out" of giving a definitive and clear answer.
Weasel words include:
- "Maybe"
- "I will try"
- "If I find the time"
- "We'll see" followed by a vague promise to revisit the topic at an undefined point in time or in some alternate universe
- "I was late, because of XXXXX"
  

It is very easy to weasel out of making a commitment, as it takes courage to take accountability for the possibility of failure.
And there will be ample times where you make a commitment and break your promise. This can happen for whatever reason, and some of those reasons might even be valid.
Though here is the kicker: **your reasons for not pulling through are irrelevant to the people counting on you**.

To ameliorate the frustration people feel when you can not live up to your promises, **give them advance warning of your inability to follow through**.
This is not a silver bullet "fix all issues" approach, as you still wrote a check they can not cash. But at the very least, you give others the opportunity to change their plans if needed.
Do this too often, and your reputation will suffer. Do not do this often enough, and you will be perceived as a liar.

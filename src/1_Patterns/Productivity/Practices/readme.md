Practices are a set of actionable recipes, that can help you achieve certain goals.
As with all advise, these are not guaranteed to give results. These is no such thing as a 
sure-fire approach that works in any situation.

In order to make these patterns as helpful as possible, they include a short description of the 
circumstances in which they usually work well.

Unlike pokemon, you will not get a special prize for implementing all of them in your life.
You are encouraged to be eclectic, and only use the practices that resonate with you.

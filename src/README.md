## About this publication

This work is a learning and development knowledge base, aimed to share knowledge with other technical professionals.
The docs section of this repository acts as somewhat of a “personal wiki”. It contains knowledge and information that
has been collected from various sources, and is extended with some personal interpretations and
experiences of the author.

> [!NOTE]
> As this knowledge base will likely remain a work in progress for some while,
> not all content will be refined. It is advisable to check out the [Changelog](/X_Appendix/HOME?id=changelog) in order
> to see what has changed recently.

### Purpose

As we live our lives, we tend to learn a great deal about a wide variety of topics.
From time to time we are stumped by how elegant, or easy, someone solves a certain problem. You are left wondering
why you have not been tackling similar problems in the same way. It could have saved you vast amounts of frustration, if
only you had known earlier.

This catalog aims to bundle little nuggets of enlightenment these aha-moments tend to deliver.
We hope that someone, somewhere learns something that makes their lives a bit more enjoyable.

### Intended Audience

This knowledge base is intended for people that are interested in improving theis current way of working (or living)
by learning about alternative approaches.
You will likely already be familiar with some ideas in this knowledge base, in which case: feel free to
move on. If you think we are blabbering and giving bad advice, feel free to leave a comment or suggestion
on the [github page](https://github.com/sddevelopment-be/penguin-pragmatic-patterns).

### Structure

This open knowledge collection is ordered by categories. Each category contains some of the following
resources:

- **A collection of Patterns:** Little snippets of information to inspire you. These can be used as general pieces of
  advice that may or may not be applicable to your current situation. To maximize their usefulness, these patterns (or
  motifs) follow a similar structure.
- **Articles and short-form information:** These sections contain a list of articles that were written by either myself
  or others and added with their permission. These articles can be opinionated pieces, additional context, or specific
  case-studies.
- **Resources and Reviews :** Additional information related to a topic, that do not easily fit the other sections.
  These might include book recommendations, tutorials, tool recommendations, etc.

A set of concepts and common abbreviations can be found in the [glossary](/X_Appendix/Glossary/HOME).

If you are interested in diving deeper into some subjects mentioned in this work, be sure to take a look at
the [Reading list](/X_Appendix/Learning_Materials/HOME) section included in the appendices. There, you will find an
overview of great books, articles, and audiovisual recourses that are worth checking out.

## A pattern-based approach

Exchanging knowledge is a challenging activity. The aim is to communicate thoughts and ideas in a way that makes them
resonate with the receiving party. To communicate effectively, groups of people tend to resort to using jargon.
The term `jargon` means: _"The specialized language of a trade, profession, or similar group,
especially when viewed as difficult to understand by outsiders."_.
Its goal is to make the exchange of information more efficient by giving specific names to things that are relevant to
the in-group. It is said that the Inuit have over thirty words to differentiate between different types of snow.
Other professions, such as software developers, strongly rely on metaphors to refer to technical concepts.

When looking for a structured way to represent ideas, experiences, or cookbooks (i.e. knowledge), it helps to first take
a look at how we see _"knowledge"_ itself. Us software developers tend to resort to modeling things when we want to
understand them a bit better. By visualizing our ideas, and how they relate to each other, we create a "map" of how we
perceive a certain set of concepts.

### Knowledge representation

The image below is an ideation map, showing us how a person gathers information. You will see how our "knowledge aggregator" interacts with 
a few relevant _"systems"_. From this simplified visualization, we see that how one perceives information is dependent of oneself, and the context one
lives in.

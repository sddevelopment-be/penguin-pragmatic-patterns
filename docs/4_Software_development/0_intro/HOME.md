There are two important tricks to being a software developer. These trade secrets make programming[^computer] a mystery
to most people.

So without further ado, here they are:

> [!TENET]
> Coding is your way of telling the computer what to do.   
> The computer will do exactly what you tell it to do, nothing less and nothing more.

The first *"secret"* is of critical importance important. You will often wonder why the computer is not
doing what you want it to do. The simple reason is: **because you didn't explain your intentions
clear enough**. A computer will follow instructions, exactly as specified.
If those instructions are not well-written, the machine will behave in ways you did not anticipate.
A lot of your time will be spent thinking, browsing through your own code, and trying to figure out where you made a
mistake.

Embrace this process.

> [!TENET]
> The best solution to any computer problem is researching it, and have a vague idea about what keywords to enter in
> your search engine of choice.

Some problems will leave you feeling stumped. You will have no idea what you are supposed to be doing to make any
progress.
First, try writing some instructions and see if it gets you anywhere. If that doesn't work, start looking at how others
have solved this particular problem.

The main advantage that _“computer people”_ have over _“non-computer people”_ is that they have knowledge of magical
words.
These words bundle up to form mysterious incantations that lead you on the fast path to success. We call these
words `technical jargon`.
Building this vocabulary usually comes with time. If you spend enough time tinkering with software and remembering some
keywords, you’ll be
able to describe your problem in a clearer way. And the more you search for answers, the more terminology you learn.
Those words can be used at later times in new searches. This way, you gradually become the go-to computer person for
your family and friends.[^0]

# Lesson one: getting your head in the game

[^computer] and computers in general, for that matter. Most people will not even bother trying to figure out what is
going on, but rather call their tech-person-on-call when any technological trinket is not behaving the way they would
expect it to.

[^0] Just remember to never agree to fixing a printer. Printers are demonic machines that operate very similar to
felines.
They pretend did not hear you when you call for them, complain about their food even though their bowl is full, and do
whatever they darn well please.
Also, they sit around sleeping most of the time.

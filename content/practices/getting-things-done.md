## Problem Statement

You find yourself constantly busy, yet achieving little of value.

## Intent

* Finalize your crucial tasks and "get things done"
* Have a consistent approach to task organization and prioritization

## Contextual forces

* People are often distracted by their own thoughts
* Multitasking is hard. Our brains work better if we can compartmentalize between different modes of thinking
* Our memories are very lossy. We tend to forget about things all the time
* Standard To-Do lists have no readily available means of prioritizing items
* Having too many things on our mind stresses us out

## Solution

Use a personalized productivity flow, using whatever tool (or combination of tools) you feel comfortable with.
For some, this will be a pen-and-paper system. Others prefer to leverage their digital prowess and lifestyle to have
their productivity tool available to them constantly[^1]. One of the most popular personal productivity methods is called the _"Getting things
done"_ method[^2].

The core of the approach is to have:
* A place to note down ideas or tasks that pop into your head
* A way to organize these by priority or type of work to do
* A calendar to plan time-allocations in
  
  
Whichever tools you choose:
* Have a specific location to dump out your thoughts
* Regularly review your brain dump tool and curate it. Some of your ideas will be crappy. Get rid of them.
* You should **trust** your tools. Peace of mind only happens when you are convinced your ideas and to-dos are stored reliably.
* Categorize and Prioritize your thoughts **after** you have collected them
    * The Eisenhower Matrix (described below) is an excellent technique to do this
    * differentiate between "things to remember" and "things that require action"
    * assign "due dates" if able

### Eisenhower priority Matrix

![./eis_matrix.png <](/images/practices/eis_matrix.png ':size=364')

Organize your action items according to:

* their **importance**: actions can be either `important` or `unimportant`
* their **urgency**: these are either `urgent` or `not urgent`

This leaves you with a nice 2-by-2 grid in which to place your actionable items[^3].
Each grid section corresponds to a specific way to handle the action items contained within:

- **eliminate or ignore** the things that are `unimportant` and `not urgent`. Because _Who cares abut these anyway?_ The
  items in this quadrant are known as "distractions" or "busy work".
- **delegate** the `unimportant` and `urgent`stuff. Something should be done about them fast, but you probably don't
  need to be the person working on them.
- **plan / schedule** the `important` and `not urgent` items. These are the things that you would really like
  to do, but never seem to get around to doing. Setting a specific date on which you will act upon these items will help you get them
  done eventually. Just make sure to stick to your schedule.
- **Do these NOW!**: `important` and `urgent`... what are you waiting for? Start working on these immediately. Just make
  sure these are important to YOU and you are not being swayed by someone else's urgency.

## Examples

### Personal productivity flow using MS online tooling

In recent years, microsoft has pivotted towards providing office-as-a-service applications.
Most if these can be easily incorporated into your personal workflow. Having everything online makes it easier to be
productive, without losing your mobility.

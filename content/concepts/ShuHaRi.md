## Definition


Shu Ha Ri is a Japanese martial arts concept that describes the stages of learning on the path to mastery.  
It represents a progression through three stages: **Shu** (Obey/Protect), **Ha** (Detach/Digress), and **Ri** (Leave/Transcend).

## Key Components

* **Shu 守 (Obey/Protect):** Learning the fundamentals by following traditions and techniques passed down from mentors. This stage involves strict
  adherence to established forms and repeated practice without deviation.
* **Ha 破 (Detach/Digress):** Innovating and breaking away from the traditions learned in the Shu stage. This stage involves exploring new methods
  and techniques, adapting and personalizing the knowledge gained.
* **Ri 離 (Leave/Transcend):** Achieving a state of flow where techniques and principles are internalized to the extent that actions become
  instinctive and effortless. The practitioner transcends formal learning and acts intuitively.

## Background

### Origin

The concept of Shu Ha Ri originates from Japanese martial arts and has been adopted in various disciplines, including software development and agile
methodologies, to describe the process of learning and mastery.

{{<quote text=`
When we learn or train in something, we pass through the stages of shu, ha, and ri. These stages are explained as follows. In shu, we
repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to these forms
with no deviation. Next, in the stage of ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In
this process the forms may be broken and discarded. Finally, in ri, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative
technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires, unhindered while not overstepping laws.

### Application

Shu Ha Ri is used to guide learners and practitioners through the stages of mastery, emphasizing the importance of foundational knowledge,
innovation, and eventual transcendence. It is applied in contexts where skill acquisition and personal growth are paramount.

### Comparisons

Shu Ha Ri can be compared to the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition, which also describes stages of learning from novice to expert. While the
Dreyfus Model focuses on the development of analytical and intuitive capabilities, Shu Ha Ri emphasizes a more holistic progression from strict
adherence to creative freedom.

When we apply the four compositional areas (Recollection, Recognition, Decision, Awareness) of the Dreyfus model to the Shu Ha Ri stages,
we can see how they align with the progression of learning and mastery. In contrast to the Dreyfus model, practitioners are considered in the
base stage of "Shu" for a longer amount of time. This due to the lack of granular subdivisions in the Shu Ha Ri model, which originates from the
martial arts tenet: _"You are a beginner, until you are no longer so"_.

* **Shu 守: Obey / Protect**
  * Recollection: Following traditional forms and techniques faithfully.
  * Recognition: Identifying and mimicking the actions of mentors and superiors.
  * Decision: Relying on established scripts and instructions.
  * Awareness: Monitoring the execution of learned techniques without deviation.

* **Ha 破: Detach / Digress**
  * Recollection: Applying learned techniques with flexibility and innovation.
  * Recognition: Recognizing when to modify or break away from traditions.
  * Decision: Experimenting with new methods and adapting techniques.
  * Awareness: Being aware of the broader context and adapting techniques accordingly.

* **Ri 離: Leave / Transcend**
  * Recollection: Internalizing knowledge to act instinctively.
  * Recognition: Understanding the principles at a profound level.
  * Decision: Making decisions intuitively and effortlessly.
  * Awareness: Operating in a state of flow, with actions driven by subconscious mastery.

### Examples

* **Software Development:** A junior developer learns by following coding standards and best practices (Shu), starts to explore new frameworks and
  methodologies and apply them when relevant (Ha). Eventually they develop an understanding that allows them to come up with solutions to tricky 
  problems intuitively (Ri).

## Concepts

### IDE

An application that helps you to develop software, by combining useful features and libraries into one single application. These IDEs usually allow you to run your tests and code without needing to leave the comfort of your development environment.

### KPI

### ROI

A concept originating from the financial sector. Described on [this page](/1_Patterns/Productivity/Concepts/HOME#return-on-investment).

### Synthesis

A term that is used to describe the act of combining (often diverse) conceptions and observations into a coherent whole. |

### Context

- The circumstances in which an event occurs; a setting.
- The part of a text or statement that surrounds a particular word or passage and determines its meaning.

### CLI

### Paradigm

A _"paradigm"_ is a fancy word for "point of view". It is the belief system that you hold and use in order to make sense of what is happening around you.
You can look at it as walking around in an unknown city, armed with a town map. If the map is not sufficiently accurate, you will find yourself ending up in the wrong place. You might even end up driving into a lake if the map is inaccurate, digital, and talks to you.

### Pragmatic

The word _'Pragmatic'_ originally means "skilled in business". You can interpret this as thinking about the added benefit (return on investment) of an action before deciding to do it.
A pragmatist will take pieces from various toolsets and methodologies, and apply them to the problem at hand only if it makes sense to use them.
This means that even if a new software architecture is really hip, you would look at the issue you are trying to solve first and see if the new approach is worth doing.

### Pattern language
[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language): A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of patterns, each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise.

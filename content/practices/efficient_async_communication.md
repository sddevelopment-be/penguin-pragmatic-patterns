## Context
You communicate with others in a semi-asynchronous way, through messaging applications.

## Problem Statement
People tend to wait for responses before stating what they want, causing unneeded distractions.

## Intent

* Send clear messages, allowing the recipient to gauge the urgency and nature of the request
* Do not waste time waiting for back-and-forth acknowledgements
* Allow people to retain their focus on their most important tasks

## Contextual forces

### Enablers

* People regard each other's time and attention as being valuable. 
* You are able to succinctly describe your intent.

### Deterrents

* People feel it is polite to say "hello" and chit-chat before asking a question or favor.
* People are not used to chat-like messaging applications.
* People expect immediate responses to their messages.

## Solution

Write your messages with enough context for the recipient to prioritize them, keeping in mind they will be read and acted upon
when it best suits your conversational partner. 

* Write multiple sentences in the same chat message
* In general, follow the structure:  
"Hello X. Could you \[request\], by \[timeframe\]. I need this in order to \[describe intent\]. I am currently \[describe context\]. "
* When asking for help, be sure to outline:
  * What you want your conversational partner to do
  * How urgent the request is
  * What you are trying to do
  * What you have tried
  * What is preventing you from continuing
* When giving an update, be sure to include:
  * Why it is relevant for the recipient
  * What has happened, what still needs to happen
  * How much time is still needed to finalize the task
  * Whether this still matches the projected timings

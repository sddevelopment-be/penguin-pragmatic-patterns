## Definition

Memento Mori is a Latin phrase meaning _"Remember you will die"_. It serves as a reminder of our mortality and encourages us to live life fully,
appreciating each moment while being mindful of the legacy we leave behind.

## Key Components

* **Awareness of Mortality:** Recognizing that life is finite and that death is an inevitable part of existence[^1].
* **Living Fully:** Using the awareness of mortality as motivation to live a meaningful and fulfilling life.
* **Legacy and Impact:** Reflecting on how one's actions and choices will be remembered and what impact they will have on others.

## Background

### Origin

The concept of Memento Mori dates back to ancient Rome, where it was used to remind individuals, particularly those in power, of their mortality.
This reminder was intended to keep them humble and focused on living virtuously.

The ancient Romans believed that being aware of our mortality, enabled us to experience life more fully and virtuously.
They advise us to understand our core values and live by them. Do not wait until tomorrow to do that which can be done today.  
If you die tomorrow, did you leave things in a good state for those that stay around?  
Did you live how you wanted to live? What will people say about who you were as a person?

While the knowledge of our own mortality can drive us to be the best version of ourselves, it can also help to not consider ourselves
indispensable. While being productive is important, we should not forget to spend time with our loved ones, or take a few moments to relax and
enjoy ourselves[^2]. After all, the graveyards are filled with indispensable people.

### Application

Memento Mori can be applied in daily life as a tool for mindfulness and reflection. It encourages individuals to prioritize what truly matters, make
the most of their time, and ensure their actions align with their values.

### Comparisons

#### Philosophical and Religious Practices

Similar to Memento Mori, the Buddhist concept of impermanence emphasizes the transient nature of life. Both philosophies encourage mindfulness and
an appreciation of the present moment, though Buddhism also focuses on the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, promoting detachment from material
possessions and desires. Memento Mori closely aligns with the Stoic practice of negative visualization, where individuals are encouraged to contemplate potential
misfortunes, including death. This practice aims to build resilience and gratitude for what one currently has, fostering a more virtuous and
meaningful life. Christianity incorporates the inevitability of death into its teachings, urging followers to live virtuously and focus on their spiritual
well-being. The concept of judgment and the afterlife further encourages ethical living and self-reflection, similar to the goals of Memento Mori.

In contrast to Memento Mori, Epicureanism focuses on seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. While Memento Mori urges individuals to consider the
long-term impact of their actions and live a meaningful life, Epicureanism prioritizes immediate gratification and the pursuit of personal
happiness. Nihilism, which also emphasizes the inevitability of death, rejects the idea of inherent meaning or purpose in life. This contrasts sharply with
Memento Mori, which encourages individuals to find personal meaning and live purposefully despite their mortality. Nihilism can lead to existential
despair, whereas Memento Mori seeks to motivate and inspire thoughtful living.

#### Mindfulness Practices

Modern mindfulness techniques, often derived from Buddhist practices, encourage living in the present moment and appreciating life as it is. These
practices, like Memento Mori, promote a deep awareness of one's actions and their impact, though mindfulness may not explicitly focus on mortality.

#### Time Management Strategies

Time management techniques, such as those advocated by Stephen Covey in "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," emphasize prioritizing important
tasks and aligning actions with personal values. While these strategies may not directly address mortality, they share the goal of making the most
of one's time and living a purposeful life.

### Examples

* **Personal Reflection:** Taking time each day to reflect on one's mortality and considering whether current actions and decisions align with
  long-term values and goals.
* **Productivity:** Using the awareness of limited time to prioritize important tasks and avoid procrastination.
* **Relationships:** Valuing and nurturing relationships, understanding that time with loved ones is finite.

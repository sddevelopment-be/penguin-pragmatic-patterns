I have the impression you are having a hard time of grasping positive and negative feedback cycles. To help you out, here is a list of all AMMERSE values, and their interactions with all other values ( giving 49 combinations, of which 7 are set to '1' to indicate a value being identical to itself).

Using these interaction weights, list the AMMERSE values, their definitions, and how they generally relate to the other values, give a succinct summary of the key interactions of each value.

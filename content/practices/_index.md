Similarly to concepts, sharing practices with people helps to create a shared understanding. It can be helpful to groups to refer to practices by their name, enabling more efficient communication.
However, without a clear description of their meaning, the use of jargon can cause confusion and misunderstandings.
<br />
<br />
To help you find practices that helps you in your particular challenges, each practice contains a description of the **context** in which you can
use it. This context is described as `enablers` and `deterrents`, these indicate under which conditions the described pattern is know to work 
well, and conversely when it doesn't work well. To get the best results, pay attention to these factors when reading the patterns below.  
<br />
Each of the patterns is accompanied by a set of `tags` and `categories`, these help you to find related learning resources, practices and concepts.
Additionally, each pattern has been scored on the different aspects of the [AMMERSE framework](https://www.ammerse.org/). This value based 
assessment aims to clarify the impact of the pattern on different aspects of your work and life.

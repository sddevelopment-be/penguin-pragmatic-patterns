If you enjoy learning and reading, one of the best sections in each book is the bibliography.
It contains a list of books that generally link to the topic you were reading about in the first place.
As I also like scavenging for new material, I aimed to add a short description to each book referenced here.
This will help you figure out why I added it to this list, and whether or not it is something you'd enjoy digging into deeper.

### Context

Quick! Think of that one person who said something, and then showed they did not mean it by how they were behaving.  
Did you think of someone? Maybe it was hard to choose only one person, as people tend to do this often.

How did you feel about that person afterwards? Do you trust them?
Do you feel they were being honest?   
Or perhaps you think they acted in the most hypocritical way imaginable [^0].
